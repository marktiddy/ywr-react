I did however watch it on iPlayer last night.</p>\n<p>I read about the documentary on Saturday and made a point of making a note that it was on. The documentary followed 13 year old Deborah and her family of 10 brothers/sisters.</p>\n<p>The family are all evangelical Christians and live in a very remote place in Dorset. All the children are home-schooled and don&#8217;t really mix with anyone other than their siblings.</p>\n<p>I have to admit I made a note of the documentary expecting to be annoyed by &#8216;bad Chrstian press&#8217; and I&#8217;m sure had the documentary been on Channel 4 I would have been, however I was pleasently surprised and think the family pose a challenge for Christians across the board!</p>\n<p>Firstly God is centainly on the agenda in their household! The day begins and ends with bible study as a family, every meal is accompanied by grace and at the end of the programme when their eldest son returns to university they pray for a safe journey. I loved that in their family prayer and looking at God&#8217;s word was right out there in the open and I only wish that more Christian families included that&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever thought of the idea of family bible study but I shall certainly think of it again!</p>\n<p>Secondly the children didn&#8217;t care about looks! Right at the start of the documentary Deborah was asked if she knew who Britney or Victoria Beckham were and she didn&#8217;t know! Deborah had no interest in fashion or reservations about her looks which in my opinion was a great thing because her self worth was based on something other than our ridiculous culture!</p>\n<p><strong>The not so good&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Although generally I think the children were in a good family atmosphere and that the older brother being at university shows that perhaps their Christian bubble upbringing isn&#8217;t a bad thing there were a few things that I raised an eye-brow at&#8230;</p>\n<p>Firstly the family were t-total and of the belief that alcohol shouldn&#8217;t be consumed by Christians&#8230;to which I&#8217;d probably enquire about Jesus&#8217; first miricle of water to wine!</p>\n<p>Secondly Deborah seemed to be very focused on the idea of people going to hell which although is technically true it seemed like she had a very negative view of the world rather than looking at the positives within it.</p>\n<p>All in all though I thought it was a positive reflection of Christianity in todays culture and a real challenge to think about how seriously we (as Christians) take our faith</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00j6l77/Deborah_13_Servant_of_God/\" target=\"_blank\">To watch it on iplayer click here</a></p>\n","slug":"deborah-13-servant-of-god"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"33ece033-2fcc-5b6a-8f88-408a7087bdd0"}}}
