On the recommendation of Dan who was on team with me at Spring Harvest. (Who also plays for Short Fall &#8211; <a href=\"www.myspace.com/shortfallofficial\" target=\"_blank\">www.myspace.com/shortfallofficial</a>) I purchased it.</p>\n<p>Since buying it I&#8217;ve spent the last few weeks reading it and it truly is an amazing book.</p>\n<p>The book aims to address the issue of unanswered prayer, not in advanced terms but in easy-to-understand terms and it does that. This is one of the best books I&#8217;ve read and Greig seems to cover every thing you could think of when it comes to unanswered prayer, not in a way that says he has all the answers but in a helpful way which helps you think about things.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s authenticity is added to buy his wive&#8217;s struggles with brain tumours and epilepsy and how that has challenged his face. This is an honest book on answered prayer that I think everyone should read!</p>\n","slug":"god-on-mute-pete-greig"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d2461b4b-74c7-5ad8-9583-09cc6dc78bd7"}}}
