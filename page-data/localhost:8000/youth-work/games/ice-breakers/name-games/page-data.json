E.G. Musical Mark.</p>\n<p>Before a young person goes they repeat everyone who&#8217;s gone before them</p>\n<p><strong>Name Confusion<br />\n</strong>This game, perhaps isn&#8217;t great for remembering names but it&#8217;s fun.</p>\n<p>Young people sit in a horse-shoe and one person is designated and number 1 (someone else at the other end of the circle will be the last place). That first person starts a rhythm that keeps going throughout the game and is done by everyone else.</p>\n<p>This rhythm is started by that first person saying &#8216;Woo&#8217; (as enthusiastically as possible) and then starting the following (with everyone joining in)</p>\n<p>1 &#8211; Slap both hands on knees<br />\n2 &#8211; Clap<br />\n3 &#8211; Click with left hand<br />\n4 &#8211; Click with right hand</p>\n<p>On the first click person 1 says their name and on the 2nd click someone else&#8217;s name. E.g. Click 1 &#8211; Jeff, Click 2 &#8211; Sarah</p>\n<p>The person whose name  is said then says their name on the first click as the rhythm continues and someone else&#8217;s on the 2nd. E.g Click 1 &#8211; Sarah, Click 2 &#8211; Mia.</p>\n<p>This process keeps going until one person either hesitates and misses their click or passes it back to the person who passed to them. That person then takes the last place in the circle and becomes whoever was sat in that space. Everyone else then moves up a seat and takes the name of the person who was on the chair they were sat on.</p>\n<p>(Note: if the 4th person in the horse-shoe messes up then the 1st, 2nd and 3rd people keep their names!)</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to become the first person!</p>\n<p><em>(There&#8217;s a less confusing version of this game in the crowd games which involves numbers!)</em></p>\n","slug":"name-games"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9e40dcc9-f984-5d63-a29e-d2daee61da8e"}}}
