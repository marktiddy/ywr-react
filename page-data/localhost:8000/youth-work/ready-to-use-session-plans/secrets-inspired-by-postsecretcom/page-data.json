A psalm.<br />\n1 O LORD, you have searched me<br />\nand you know me.<br />\n2 You know when I sit and when I rise;<br />\nyou perceive my thoughts from afar.<br />\n3 You discern my going out and my lying down;<br />\nyou are familiar with all my ways.<br />\n4 Before a word is on my tongue<br />\nyou know it completely, O LORD.<br />\n5 You hem me in—behind and before;<br />\nyou have laid your hand upon me.<br />\n6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,<br />\ntoo lofty for me to attain.<br />\n7 Where can I go from your Spirit?<br />\nWhere can I flee from your presence?<br />\n8 If I go up to the heavens, you are there;<br />\nif I make my bed in the depths, you are there.<br />\n9 If I rise on the wings of the dawn,<br />\nif I settle on the far side of the sea,<br />\n10 even there your hand will guide me,<br />\nyour right hand will hold me fast.<br />\n11 If I say, &#8220;Surely the darkness will hide me<br />\nand the light become night around me,&#8221;<br />\n12 even the darkness will not be dark to you;<br />\nthe night will shine like the day,<br />\nfor darkness is as light to you.<br />\n13 For you created my inmost being;<br />\nyou knit me together in my mother&#8217;s womb.<br />\n14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;<br />\nyour works are wonderful,<br />\nI know that full well.<br />\n15 My frame was not hidden from you<br />\nwhen I was made in the secret place.<br />\nWhen I was woven together in the depths of the earth,<br />\n16 your eyes saw my unformed body.<br />\nAll the days ordained for me<br />\nwere written in your book<br />\nbefore one of them came to be.<br />\n17 How precious to  me are your thoughts, O God!<br />\nHow vast is the sum of them!<br />\n18 Were I to count them,<br />\nthey would outnumber the grains of sand.<br />\nWhen I awake,<br />\nI am still with you.<br />\n19 If only you would slay the wicked, O God!<br />\nAway from me, you bloodthirsty men!<br />\n20 They speak of you with evil intent;<br />\nyour adversaries misuse your name.<br />\n21 Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD,<br />\nand abhor those who rise up against you?<br />\n22 I have nothing but hatred for them;<br />\nI count them my enemies.<br />\n23 Search me, O God, and know my heart;<br />\ntest me and know my anxious thoughts.<br />\n24 See if there is any offensive way in me,<br />\nand lead me in the way everlasting. <strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><br />\nExplain:</strong> </strong>The psalm reminds us that God knows all of us, he has known us since before we were born and knows everything we do, or think and that’s scary…but although it’s scary it’s great because even though God knows the things we think that we shouldn’t, and the things we do we shouldn’t he still loves us.<br />\nOn the post secret video we saw a lot of people’s secrets, we saw people’s fears and anxieties…and I’d like to give you a chance to make your own this evening. <strong><br />\n<strong><br />\nPost Secret Activity: </strong></strong>Hand out some felt tips and some Post Cards and ask the young people to have a go at writing their own, you might like to play some quiet background music throughout this time and then collect in the secrets anonomously and share them as a group</p>\n<p>After perhaps get the group to pray about the secrets etc.</p>\n","slug":"secrets-inspired-by-postsecretcom"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8acc0c1b-6971-5d80-8e13-cbd976b09f00"}}}
