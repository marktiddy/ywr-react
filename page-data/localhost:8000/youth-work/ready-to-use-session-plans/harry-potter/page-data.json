Have a look at these two leaflets</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation</strong> &#8211; previous to this session you will need to search around on the internet for both positive and negative Christian opinions on Harry Potter and make some copies of these views</p>\n<p><strong>Ask:</strong> Hand Out Harry Potter Pro and Negative leaflets and ask the group to read through them<strong></p>\n<p>Ask</strong> Ask the group what they think of the two very different leaflets?</p>\n<p><strong>Ask </strong> Would you say that Harry Potter encourages the use of magic and witchcraft?</p>\n<p><strong>Explain </strong> Lets have a look at what magic and the occult, mentioned in both these leaflets really is and what the bible says about them.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the Occult?<br />\n</strong><strong><br />\nBrainstorm</strong> What do you think the occult is?<br />\n(Occult could be&#8230; Witchcraft, Cults, Tarrot Cards, Mediums, Fortune Telling, Reading your star sign blurb)<br />\n<strong>Ask </strong> What do people look for in the Occult?</p>\n<p><strong>Bible</strong> Read Isaiah 47: 8-15<br />\n<strong>Ask</strong> What are the people in Isaiah looking for in magic?<br />\n<strong><br />\nAnswer –</strong> Some kind of control, either to know the future or influence the present in some way. This may be because of a basic need for security. Also people are aware of a spiritual dimension to life and are looking for spiritual solutions that work. God&#8217;s the only one that works!!!</p>\n<p><strong>Ask </strong> Why is God against the Occult?<br />\n<strong>Explain </strong> The main problem is that the occult looks to other spiritual forces rather than God. This is the root of all sin. In particular it stops people listening to God and obeying him. <strong>Bible </strong></p>\n<p>Read 1 Samuel 28:3-20</p>\n<p>The Occult or fortune teller in the story is used as an alternative to God!</p>\n<p><strong>Bible </strong> Read Deuteronomy 18: 9-16</p>\n<p><strong>Ask </strong> What is the basic sin being committed by people practicing the occult?</p>\n<p><strong>Bible </strong> Leviticus 20:6 – <em>I will be against anyone who goes to mediums and fortune-tellers for advice, because that person is being unfaithful to me. So I will cut him off from his people.<br />\n</em><br />\n<strong>Explain</strong> Our relationship with God should be like a friendship or relationship and therefore we should be faithful to God who tells us not to worship anything but him and trust in him.<br />\n<strong>Ask </strong> What&#8217;s going on?<br />\n<strong>Read </strong> Harry Potter Quote: &#8211; &#8216;He had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortune-telling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner&#8217;</p>\n<p>The bible both old and new testament see the occult practices as a mixture of trickery and real power drawn from demonic beings. The bible is clear that ultimately they all fail.</p>\n<p><strong>Bible </strong> Read Isaiah 47: 8-15</p>\n<p><strong>Ask </strong>Think of the ways which their magic fails?</p>\n<p>Is there anyway there where our attitudes could be similar to those described even if we don&#8217;t engage in magic?<br />\n<strong><br />\nBut what about?<br />\n</strong><br />\nRead Matthew 2:1 – Think about what reasons God might have for choosing some Magi to come and worship the baby Jesus?</p>\n<p><strong>Bible </strong>Read Daniel 1:1-7 – Put yourself in Daniel&#8217;s position in the first few days of his exile</p>\n<p><strong>Bible </strong> Read verses 8-21 – How does Daniel respond? How do you think you would have responded?<strong>Explain </strong></p>\n<p>Daniel eventually became &#8216;chief of magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners&#8217; (Dan: 5:11) How do you think he was able to handle being a believer in God in such a position for all those years?</p>\n<p><strong>Questions </strong>Allow this time for the group to ask their own questions and discuss/debate Harry Potter<strong>Prayer</strong> Close by praying for God to be centre of our lives, asking him to help us be wise when it comes to the occult</p>\n","slug":"harry-potter"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e77f57b9-19e7-5028-abb7-5e42425564d5"}}}
