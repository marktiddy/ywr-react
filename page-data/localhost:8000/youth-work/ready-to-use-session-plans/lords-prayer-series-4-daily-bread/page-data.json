How would you afford to?</p>\n<p><strong>Explain:</strong> To a certain extent that’s the sort of dependancy the \t\t\t\tIsraelites had on God, except whereas we could go to \t\t\t\tfriends for food they couldn’t because their friends \t\t\t\tdidn’t have food either.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask:</strong> Think about how they felt when they had food for the \t\t\t\tfirst time in 16 days&#8230;how would you have felt?</p>\n<p>Do you think there’s anything significant about the food \t\t\t\tgoing mouldy if kept overnight?<br />\n(God wanted to provide what they needed and not \t\t\t\tbeyond?)</p>\n<p><strong>Ask:</strong> Have you ever had to depend on God for something?</p>\n<p><strong>Explain</strong>:\t\tThe early disciples sold everything they had, they were \t\t\tcompletely dependent on God for their next meal, for \t\t\tshelter over night even for the clothes on their back&#8230;we \t\t\toften forget that it is God who provides for us, he \t\t\tprovides us for the people in our lives who look after us, \t\t\twho make sure we’re fed and watered and clothed and \t\t\tsheltered. When we say a grace before a meal we begin \t\t\tto acknowledge that God has provided our essentials \t\t\tbut we only begin to.</p>\n<p><strong>Prayers</strong></p>\n<p><em>Pass around the group an object and when each young person has the object they will need to say ‘Thank You God for&#8230;’ and mention an essential God has blessed them with.</em></p>\n<p>To conclude the prayer it’s good for the leader to pray&#8230;you may also like to challenge the young people to look at their world this week with eyes looking our for what God provides for them.</p>\n","slug":"lords-prayer-series-4-daily-bread"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f0e35f50-0e7c-569e-b53e-b2b73a2743d8"}}}
