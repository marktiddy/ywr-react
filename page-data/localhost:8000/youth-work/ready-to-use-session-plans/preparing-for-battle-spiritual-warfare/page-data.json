(Perhaps explain that we now have Salvation which means Jesus has already one for us and we can have the strength to use the rest of the armour)<br />\nWhat would you do?<br />\n<strong><br />\nExplain </strong>&#8211;\tThe group will get a series of scenarios, they must think about and discuss how they’d react<br />\n<strong><br />\nScenario 1 </strong>&#8211; Someone at school offers to copy their entire CD collection for you, you are broke and don’t have the money to buy the albums yourself, they even have the new Cliff Richard album you desperately want! What would you do?<br />\n<strong><br />\nScenario 2</strong> &#8211; You are known as a loser at school who hangs around with the geeks, you are invited to a big party where all the cool people are, but you remember that you’re meant to be having a sleepover with the geeks, what do you do?<br />\n<strong><br />\nScenario 3 &#8211; </strong>You finally get broadband in your bedroom, over msn one of your friends tells you about an ‘amazing’ pornography site. What would you do?<br />\n<strong><br />\nActivity</strong> &#8211; Get the group to try and come up with a rap based on temptation, it could be using one of the scenarios just discussed or one of their own, it could include their reaction from a Christian point of view.<br />\n<strong><br />\nRe-Read</strong> &#8211;\tEphesians 6: 10 –18<br />\n<strong><br />\nDiscuss!</strong> &#8211; Get the group to think about why each one of the items of armour is important in their life and how it can be applied. Perhaps leaders give examples in their own as the discussion takes place. You can also link the experience of Jesus to their lives and temptations here.<br />\n<strong><br />\nResponse &#8211; </strong>Give everyone a piece of paper and a pen, play some quiet music and ask them to think about an area of their life they struggle with temptation. Have some candles on a table and allow them to each light a candle as a response to God to symbolise that they want his light in their life.<br />\nAllow time for quiet, personal prayer.</p>\n","slug":"preparing-for-battle-spiritual-warfare"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"256f60ff-173d-5c5d-afa8-781b94b23de4"}}}
