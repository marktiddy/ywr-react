(With his own revival, telling people the story)</p>\n<p>How do you think he got people along to his event? (Inviting people)</p>\n<p><strong>Explain</strong>: A lot of the time people come to church because they are invited by someone they know, people become interested in church by hearing our stories, by hearing the exciting things that go on and that&#8217;s what youth group socials are all about, they&#8217;re about helping you to invite friends to church events, helping you to share your faith.</p>\n<p><em>Here is a good chance to encourage young people along to your group…perhaps you could get them to think of socials they could bring their friends to!</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just down to you to tell your friends!</p>\n<p><strong>Bible</strong>: Acts 5:12-17 Luke 19: 1-11</p>\n<p><strong>Ask</strong>: In those passages how to we see people sharing their faith?</p>\n<p><strong>Ask</strong>: Have you ever invited someone to church/doodles/survival? Did it work? how did it make you feel?</p>\n<p><strong>Explain</strong>: When we invite people to events we should be praying for them prior to and after asking them, even if they don&#8217;t accept our invitation then we need to remember that God is in control and that if we keep praying for them, showing them God in our lives and through the way we act then the seeds we sew may eventually be made into something in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Testimony</strong>:        Ask a leader to share a testimony</p>\n<p><strong>Response &amp; Prayer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explain</strong>: Tonight I&#8217;m going to ask all of you to think of someone you&#8217;d like to come to youth group and/or become a Christian, we&#8217;ll hand out some cards which you can fill in for that person then I&#8217;d like you to get into two&#8217;s, discuss that person you&#8217;ve written down and why and then spend a few minutes praying for them.</p>\n<p><strong>Close with prayer</strong></p>\n","slug":"sharing-faith-2"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4ac75028-98bd-50a4-a690-bf2beeec39c7"}}}
