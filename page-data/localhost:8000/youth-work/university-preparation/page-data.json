Thats a shocking statistic. The university years are to be treasured and enjoyed. They are an opportunity to lean and explore new things and they will help you determine the course of the rest of our life. The church family is the most important community to be a part of at university, to encourage and support you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fusion have helped prepare tens of thousands of students for their university years. We help students think about the kind of person they want to be at university, and these resources will help you not just survive university but thrive throughout your university years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Student Link Up App</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LINKUP-ADVERT-186x133mm--1024x698.jpg\" alt=\"Student Link-Up App\" class=\"wp-image-1801\" srcset=\"https://http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LINKUP-ADVERT-186x133mm--1024x698.jpg 1024w, https://http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LINKUP-ADVERT-186x133mm--150x102.jpg 150w, https://http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LINKUP-ADVERT-186x133mm--300x204.jpg 300w, https://http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LINKUP-ADVERT-186x133mm-.jpg 1098w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Download our FREE Student Linkup app to help you find the perfect church for you at university.

The book is creatively designed and practically focused around four areas; The Start, The Culture, The Opportunities and The Legacy. This preparation is key to your personal and spiritual growth at university; taking some time to work out who you want to be during your time at university, what God wants to say to you and what your values and priorities are before you get to university is an invaluable place to start. It can be read as an individual or in a group as part of a preparation for university course. The Student Linkup Sessions are also available as part of The Student Linkup Box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fusion.uk.com/sessions\">www.fusion.uk.com/sessions</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Blogs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Let’s party like Jesus</b>&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.fusion.uk.com/blog/635\">www.fusion.uk.com/blog/635</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Break a leg…literally</b> <a href=\"http://www.fusion.uk.com/blog/657\">www.fusion.uk.com/blog/657</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Bottling it </b><a href=\"http://www.fusion.uk.com/blog/662\">www.fusion.uk.com/blog/662</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Together, not alone </b><a href=\"http://www.fusion.uk.com/blog/647\">www.fusion.uk.com/blog/647</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>&nbsp;Resources &amp; Downloads from Youth Work Resource</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sessions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Money, Money, Money – University Tips!\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/university-preparation/money-money-money-university-tips/\">Money &#8211; A session exploring money for university preparation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Downloads</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Student Downloads\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/student-downloads/\">A selection of downloads aimed at students heading off to university,</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ideas for using these resources (from youthworkresource.com)</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cell Group</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not start up a cell group for your year 13&#8217;s from the September when they enter year 13? Year 13 is a busy year so perhaps just keep it as a monthly thing. If you can feed them too that&#8217;ll help! Mark has been running a group like this 1 monday a month including a meal (which can be cooked by different church families) from 6:30pm until 8:45pm which gives them enough time to go home and do any work they need to!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Commissioning Service</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not have a commissioning service for your leavers a few weeks before they head off and encourage the church to be praying for them as they head off on their new mission! You could even present them with a school leaver pack as part of this service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meet Up at Christmas!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve done a cell group before your group head off for University put another in for the Christmas when they first come home&#8230;keep in contact via text, Facebook or even in person and encourage them to share their experience with each other.</p>\n","slug":"university-preparation"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"91a80f4a-b59a-51ed-8657-c51a168f83ab"}}}
