You could adapt it for one person to deliver it. The &#8216;Guess The Santa&#8217; game requires some preparation (see description of the game later on in the assembly). We also gave away the onesies we used as a competition throughout the week.</p>\n<p><b>Equipment: </b>Laptop, Projector, Speakers, Retooning the Nativity Video (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-4y5mK_o9E\"><b>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-4y5mK_o9E</b></a>), Christmas clothing (as ridiculous as possible) and 2 Christmas onesies.</p>\n<p><i>At the start of the assembly 2 people, both wearing Christmas onesies walk on.</i></p>\n<p><b>Person 1: </b>Good morning everyone, We’re here this morning to bring you an assembly that is a little bit different as we approach Christmas and I don’t know about you but as I walk around the shops at Christmas and see all the different Christmas things I wonder if it’s all got a bit ridiculous.</p>\n<p>(<i>Both look at onesies at this point)</i></p>\n<p><b>Person 2: </b>And so this morning we’re going to see if Christmas has got a bit ridiculous or if it’s always been like that.</p>\n<p>So let’s start off by playing a game…guess the santa!</p>\n<p><b>Guess The Santa Game</b></p>\n<p><i>In advance you will have needed to get some photos of teachers from the school dressed in a santa hat and beard. If you can&#8217;t manage that perhaps use some well known celebrities&#8230;lots of websites have done &#8216;celebrities dressed as santa&#8217; games.</i></p>\n<p>Show the photos and ask the young people to guess who they think the Santa is.</p>\n<p><b>Person 1: </b>Ok so there’s lots of santa’s around at Christmas but that doesn’t make Christmas ridiculous…it’s just a bit of fun.</p>\n<p><b>Person 2: </b>True but have you seen the amount of Christmas stuff there is…there’s not just Christmas onesies…there’s all sorts of Christmas stuff around…allow me to show you. Here’s a bag of Christmas things…</p>\n<p><i>Ask for a volunteer to come up and be dressed in all sorts of Christmas things (we fixed a Christmas tree to a bike helmet!)</i></p>\n<p><b>Person 1: </b>Look at all the Christmas things you can get…there’s a Christmas jumper, we have Christmas socks, we have some baubles you can wear on your ears, we have some tinsel, we can add some lights…we even have a tree.</p>\n<p><i>Looks at the person dressed up.</i></p>\n<p>Ok, maybe Christmas is getting a little bit silly</p>\n<p>(<i>Invite the person dressed up to take a seat near the front)</i></p>\n<p><b>Person 2: </b>See, I was right. Christmas has gotten ridiculous.</p>\n<p><b>Person 1</b>: Maybe…but wasn’t it always verging on the ridiculous. In the Christmas story you have Mary being visited by an Angel, getting pregnant, travelling on a donkey for miles and giving birth in a stable…and that’s before there’s a load of shepherds, sheep and wise men with really odd gifts</p>\n<p><b>Person 2</b>: It wasn’t quite like that…we have changed the story a bit. This video explains it.</p>\n<p><b>Video</b>: Retooning The Nativity</p>\n<p><b>Person 2: </b>Whilst it may feel like Christmas can be a little bit silly sometimes behind all the Christmas onesies, Christmas jumpers &amp; busy nativity scenes there’s actually something really exciting and something we really should be celebrating.</p>\n<p><b>Person 1: </b>Thanks for listening…if you would like to win one of the Christmas onesies from this assembly there’s a competition on the Christian Union page of the VLE (school intranet). We’ll announce the winners and get the prizes out Friday lunchtime.</p>\n<p>Full details are on the screen.</p>\n<p>We hope you all have a fantastic Christmas</p>\n","slug":"christmas-virgin-on-the-ridiculous"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ec23f6eb-f654-5889-8abb-7330f844287a"}}}
