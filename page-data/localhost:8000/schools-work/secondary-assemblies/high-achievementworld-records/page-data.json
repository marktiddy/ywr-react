So I thought we’d do a bit of a quiz about world records!</p>\n<p><b>World Records Quiz (Use PowerPoint &#8211; Answers on the powerpoint)</b></p>\n<p>1 &#8211; What is the most revolutions (spins) of a hula hoop in one minute?

Breaking records takes commitment, dedication and probably a lot of organising and breaking records is a big achievement to have.</p>\n<p>But we all have different achievements to aim for. For me even doing 5 hoops with the hula hoop would be a big achievement and it’s important that we try and do the best we can.</p>\n<p>The world’s biggest selling book by a long-way is the bible and it gives us some advice on achieving.</p>\n<p>In one book in the New Testament a guy called Paul, who did a lot of work in telling people about Christianity and setting up churches wrote to one of those churches and said:</p>\n<p>“I do not mean that I am already as God wants me to be. I have not yet reached that goal, but I continue trying to reach it and make it mine.”</p>\n<p>So one of the things I believe as a Christian is that God wants us to do the best we possibly can and whether you believe in God or not I hope that you will see that little section of the bible and this mornings assembly as encouragement to try your best because whether you are able to make giant cheese cakes, be an incredible footballer or get to the next grade on a musical instrument you play we can all achieve great things.</p>\n<p>We just need to aim to achieve more and press on towards our goals.</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening</p>\n<p><strong>World Record Sources</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/most-revolutions-hula-hooping-in-one-minute/\">http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/most-revolutions-hula-hooping-in-one-minute/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-cheesecake/\">http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-cheesecake/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-9000/most-wins-of-the-worlds-strongest-woman/\">http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-9000/most-wins-of-the-worlds-strongest-woman/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-7000/highest-full-setlist-score-on-rock-band-2-(drums)/\">http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-7000/highest-full-setlist-score-on-rock-band-2-(drums)/</a></p>\n<p>http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-game-of-duck-duck-goose/</p>\n","slug":"high-achievementworld-records"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c8a72edb-5ae0-5a4c-9d3f-7ceb1b940679"}}}
