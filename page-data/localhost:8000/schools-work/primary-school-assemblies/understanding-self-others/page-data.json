Tell her to help me!”</p>\n<p>Jesus thought for a second and replied, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things but few things are needed…Mary has chosen what is better.”</p>\n<p><b>Explain: </b>In that story Martha invited Jesus around but then is so busy that she doesn’t spend any time with him whereas Mary spends time with Jesus.</p>\n<p>When Martha asks Jesus why he isn’t cross that Mary isn’t helping he tells Martha that he understands how she is feeling and all the things she’s worried about and concerned about.</p>\n<p>That story reminds us that we’re all different and we all do things differently but that Jesus understands all of us and that it’s important that we try and understand each other too.</p>\n<p><b>Reflection: </b>Invite the children to think about the words of this part of Psalm 139 (New Century Version)</p>\n<p>Lord, you have examined me<br />\nand know all about me.</p>\n<p>You know when I sit down and when I get up.<br />\nYou know my thoughts before I think them.</p>\n<p>You know where I go and where I lie down.<br />\nYou know everything I do.</p>\n<p>Lord, even before I say a word,<br />\nyou already know it.</p>\n<p>You are all around me—in front and in back—<br />\nand have put your hand on me.</p>\n<p>Your knowledge is amazing to me;<br />\nit is more than I can understand.</p>\n<p>You made my whole being;<br />\nyou formed me in my mother’s body.</p>\n<p>I praise you because you made me in an amazing and wonderful way.<br />\nWhat you have done is wonderful.<br />\nI know this very well.</p>\n<p>You saw my bones being formed<br />\nas I took shape in my mother’s body.<br />\nWhen I was put together there,</p>\n<p>you saw my body as it was formed.<br />\nAll the days planned for me<br />\nwere written in your book<br />\nbefore I was one day old.</p>\n<p><b>Prayer:<br />\n</b>Dear God,<br />\nThank you that you have made each of us differently and that you know each of us.<br />\nHelp us to understand each other more whether we’re upset about something or really excited about something.<br />\nAmen</p>\n","slug":"understanding-self-others"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1100e8ee-9483-5908-a375-c540d9bbe73c"}}}
