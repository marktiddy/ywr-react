The Church of England&#8217;s Parish Resources site has some great guidelines on this. <a href=\"http://www.parishresources.org.uk/gdpr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can find this information here.</a> We have now updated the forms below to comply to this but you will need to make tweaks to them for your organisation in order to make sure they comply with your own policies and procedures.</em></p>\n<p>For consent forms and advice around social media you can also check your local Diocesan (if you&#8217;re Church of England) website as they often have lots of great resource under the safeguarding section.</p>\n<p><strong>Using Social Networking in Youth Ministry/Work &#8211; Sample Child Protection Policy<br />\n</strong><em>A sample child protection policy for using social networking in youth ministry.
