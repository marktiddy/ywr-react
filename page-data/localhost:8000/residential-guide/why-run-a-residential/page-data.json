For example a residential in September can help young people moving up into a group to settle in and get to know others, it can also give you a good chance to build a relationship with them.</p>\n<p>Another example of the varied benefits could be the style of weekend (for more information see &#8216;Where to book&#8217;), an active weekend full of activities such as Absailing and Climbing can be really good for helping a group to bond, helping them develop team work and also help young people conquour fears and grow in confidence, however at the same time these weekends can leave young people a little too tired to concentrate on more &#8216;Christian&#8217; aspects but they can work very well.</p>\n<p>On the other hand a more relaxed weekend can have slightly more of a relaxed, God-focus. It can give you a chance to chill-out with the young people perhaps playing football or on the beach and at the same time this extra time can give you a chance to help the young people explore their faith further and be challenged in their commitment to God.</p>\n<p>All of these reasons which I have briefly touched upon hopefully explain why residentials are a great thing for youth groups, often they provide awesome chances for God to work&#8230;being away from the business of life gives you people a chance to focus on Him. At the same time the build up to the residential will get the young people excited, they&#8217;ll be buzzing when they arrive and probably be buzzing just as much when they go home!!!</p>\n<p><strong>To continue with our residential guide <a href=\"?page_id=773\">click here to go back to the list of topics</a></strong></p>\n","slug":"why-run-a-residential"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0965405e-98f1-5611-815b-3256df82eb45"}}}
