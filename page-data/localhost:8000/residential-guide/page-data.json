We have provided some mock-up leaflets, forms and medical forms which have actually been used by myself to run successful youth group weekends away. We have also put together a rough guide to budgeting and some ideas of activities for you, we hope this section helps you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please choose a topic from below to continue our residential guide</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Organised Residentials\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/organised-residentials/\">Pre-Organised Residentials</a> &#8211;&nbsp;<em>Don&#8217;t feel up to running your own&#8230;check out our guide to pre-organised ones for you and your youth groups.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Why Run A Residential?\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/why-run-a-residential/\">Why Run A Residential?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Practicalities – Start Here\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/practicalities-start-here/\">Practicalities</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Types of Residential\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/types-of-residential/\">Types of Residential</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Residential Budgeting\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/residential-budgeting/\">Residential Budgeting</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Booking A Site\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/booking-a-site/\">Booking A Site</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Find A Residential Centre\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/find-a-residential-centre/\"><strong>Find A Residential Centre</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Promoting Your Event\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/promoting-your-event/\">Promoting Your Event</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Planning A Timetable\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/planning-a-timetable/\">Planning A Timetable</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Managing the Food\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/managing-the-food/\">Managing The Food</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Activity Ideas\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/activity-ideas/\">Activity ideas</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Content Ideas – Residential Session Series\" href=\"http://http://localhost:8000/residential-guide/content-ideas-residential-session-series/\">Content Ideas &#8211; Teaching material suggestions</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n","slug":"residential-guide"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a483312c-2a15-575e-8c2e-d328fdf78a2a"}}}
