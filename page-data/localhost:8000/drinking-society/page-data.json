I&#8217;m not saying don&#8217;t drink, I&#8217;m saying enjoy it, and glorify God at all times and in my opinion that means not getting drunk.</p>\n<p>Just some thoughts for you&#8230;.I needed a rant!</p>\n<p>On a final unrelated thought I think it&#8217;s about time the press left poor Britney Spears alone, maybe she wouldn&#8217;t be breaking down if they didn&#8217;t put so much pressure and stress on her!</p>\n","slug":"drinking-society"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"164fc4ca-bc3e-5b26-96d0-2632e6e57787"}}}
