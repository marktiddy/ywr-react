If you succeed then that person’s hand is out.</li>\n<li>You must stay still when it’s not your turn unless someone is going for your hand in which case, if you’re quick enough, you can move your hand out the way.</li>\n<li>Once a player loses both of their hands they are out<strong>.</strong></li>\n<li>The game ends when only one person has any hands left.</li>\n<li>Note: Once you’ve been round once the game works best if people remember when their go is and if they go straight after the previous person…this makes the game fast and fun!
