Tonight \t\t\twe’ve going to explore the Christmas story in a couple of different \t\t\tways, first let’s think about some practical issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Practicals</strong>:\t\tMary is told she’s pregnant by the Holy Spirit &#8211; She’s unmarried \t\t\t(adultery is a stoning offense) and also probably only 14 or 15.</p>\n<p>Joseph finds out his wife-to-be is pregnant&#8230;has she been unfaithful to \t\t\thim? The whole Holy Spirit story sounds a bit far-fetched!</p>\n<p>So Mary and Joesph are having a pretty tough time, let’s have a look \t\t\tat how Joseph may have reacted in the beginning!</p>\n<p><strong>Drama Sketch</strong>:\tHave 3 of your leaders prepare the drama sketch from myfishbites &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.myfishbites.com/sketches-christmas.php\" target=\"_blank\">link</a></p>\n<p><strong>Discuss</strong>:\t\tWhat other struggles happened in the Christmas story?</p>\n<p><strong>Explain</strong>:\t\tSometimes we forget how shocking to the people reading it some of \t\t\tthe things in the Christmas story were (bizarrely probably not the baby \t\t\tkilling!), so let’s look at a modern day version of the story</p>\n<p><strong>Small Groups</strong>:\tSplit the group into smaller groups and hand them the modern day \t\t\tChristmas story (see extra download) and questions, ask them to read \t\t\tthrough it and think of their reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Sharing</strong>:\t\tAsk the groups to share their thoughts with the rest of the group</p>\n<p><strong>Explain</strong>:\t\tSometimes we forget the power of the Christmas story and the bizarre \t\t\tcircumstances in which Jesus was born into this world, we get too \t\t\tcaught up in cute nativity stories where the stable is actually quite nice \t\t\tand forget that in todays terms it was worse than a cold council flat, \t\t\twe forget the worries that Mary and Joseph would have had and \t\t\tperhaps even the strain it put on their relationship, did Joseph have \t\t\tdoubts about the baby really being from God?</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge</strong>:\t\tThe challenge for all of us in this story is to remember that God can do \t\t\tamazing things, that when we choose to give our lives to Him it’s not a \t\t\tsmall change but a massive change, we just need to be prepared to \t\t\tlet God work in us listen to Mary’s Song from Luke, sung just after she \t\t\tfound out she was going to have God’s baby!</p>\n<p><strong>Reading:</strong> Ask a female leader to read Luke 1:46-55 from The Message</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge</strong>:\t\tSo as Christmas approach’s think of the Christmas story for what it \t\t\treally is, a story full of mystery, fear and challenge, a story that \t\t\treminds us that we should be prepared for God to turn our lives upside \t\t\tdown and use us!</p>\n","slug":"christmas-for-real"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1ac63cd4-4a40-59e6-9ba5-835c7355395a"}}}
