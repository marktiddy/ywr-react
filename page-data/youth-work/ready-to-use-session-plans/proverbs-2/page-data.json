Give each person 6 cards and put the remaining cards in the middle. One player starts by asking another if they have something i.e. ‘Player 1, do you have any Kings?’, if that player does they must pass them over and player 1 goes again, if not they reply with ‘Go fish’ and the player picks up a card from the middle. Play then passes onto the person who was asked. Players can only ask for cards they already have so you couldn’t ask for a King if you didn’t have any. The winner is the player with the most sets.</i></p>\n<p><b>Challenge: </b>Can you travel round the room just using 2 A4 pieces of paper (Clue: The key is to step on one piece and place the next in front before stepping onto that and picking up the last piece)</p>\n<p><b>Explain</b>: Sometimes things go wrong or are tricky for us and when we have wisdom we can use that to help us keep moving forward.</p>\n<p>Ask the group how they’d complete the following sentences</p>\n<p>&#8211; I know there is a God because&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; The universe is here because&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; God is like a drug because&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; Atheism is&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; If I could ask God one question it would be&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; The meaning of life is&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; If there is a God then why&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; The best way to find God is to&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; The power behind life is&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; The most important thing is&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; God is like&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; You’ll never prove God because&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; Being a Christian is hard because&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being a Christian is easy because&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Say</b></p>\n<p>A huge part of gaining wisdom is being honest about what you think, listening with an open mind to what others think and in the middle of that, asking God to teach you what to think. Wisdom comes from honest conversation with God. Do you talk to him honestly? Do you ask Him questions? Are you digging into the Bible, and into these sessions with Christian mates to learn more from Him? Wisdom is a treasure and it’s worth the effort!</p>\n<p><b>Values Pyramid: </b>Ask the group to think about what influences them and draw a pyramid on their piece of paper and fill it with their influences putting the most important things at the top followed by the least.</p>\n<p><b>Read: </b>Have a look at Proverbs 4:23</p>\n<p>What most stood out for you from that passage?</p>\n<p>What does this verse tell us about how we should live?</p>\n<p>Is that a challenge?</p>\n<p>What does it mean to guard your heart?</p>\n<p>When the Bible says something like ‘above all else’ you just know it’s going to be really important! This is one of those ‘not-to-be-missed’ moments, a make or break in your Christian journey. Your heart is so valuable! “Everything you do flows from it.” To guard something you’ve got to be vigilant, and ready &#8211; you need to watch and listen for danger and take it out before it gets a chance to attack. In our culture there are so many things that want to pull your heart away from God.</p>\n<p><b>Ask</b></p>\n<p>What sort of things can you think of that tend to pull you away from God?
