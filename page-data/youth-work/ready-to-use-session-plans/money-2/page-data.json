Encourage each young person to present these things to the rest of the group.</p>\n<p><strong>Ice Breaker Part 2</strong>:     Explain to the young people that now they have a budget of only £200. Ask them to choose what they would get from Argos with that money. (See extra sheet for this activity)</p>\n<p><strong>Explain</strong>: Money is a big issue! It’s something we all have to deal with in one form or another at every point of our life whether it’s deciding if we can afford to go for a coffee with friends from school or whether we buy or rent a house&#8230;money has big implications on our lives!</p>\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong>:     <em>Do you get pocket money?
