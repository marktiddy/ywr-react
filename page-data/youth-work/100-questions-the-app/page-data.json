It is available for iOS and (finally) Android.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app contains 100 random questions ideal for ice breaker settings. The questions cover a range of topics including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Getting to know each other</li><li>Hopes and dreams</li><li>Beliefs</li><li>Social justice</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.marktiddy.questions_youth_2\"><img src=\"http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/badge_new.png\" alt=\"Get it on Android\" class=\"wp-image-2388\" srcset=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/badge_new.png 153w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/badge_new-150x46.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/100-questions-youth/id1387964565\"><img src=\"http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_blk_092917.png\" alt=\"Download on the Apple App Store\" class=\"wp-image-2389\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To use the app you simply download it from the relevant app store, open it up and you&#8217;re presented with one of the questions. To move onto the next question you tap the button at the base of the screen or shake your device. The 100 questions are displayed in a random order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How could you use the app?<br></strong>As we created the app we had a few ideas in mind of how you could use it:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 &#8211; Mentoring &#8211; It&#8217;s perfect for using in a mentoring session especially when you first get to know a mentee. You could shake your phone and answer the question and pass it across and repeat the process or both answer each question&#8230;use it for as long or little as you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2 &#8211; Youth Groups &#8211; When you&#8217;ve got a new group to get to know them you could pass your device around a circle (If you want to lock the app to the screen so other apps can&#8217;t be used whilst using it then <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202612\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">check out the article on guided access from Apple</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 &#8211; On a screen! &#8211; If you&#8217;ve got a bigger event and an AppleTV or lightning to VGA/HDMI adapter you could present the app onto the big screen and use it with a bigger group!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Questions, comments and suggestions</strong><br>We hope you like the app and find it useful. If you have questions, comments, suggestions or ideas of what our next app should be then do get in touch!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.marktiddy.questions_youth_2\"><img src=\"http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/badge_new.png\" alt=\"Get it on Android\" class=\"wp-image-2388\" srcset=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/badge_new.png 153w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/badge_new-150x46.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/100-questions-youth/id1387964565\"><img src=\"http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_blk_092917.png\" alt=\"Download on the Apple App Store\" class=\"wp-image-2389\"/></a></figure></div>\n","slug":"100-questions-the-app"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"90066f4c-c28f-55a0-9d6d-d79e81440bc2"}}}
