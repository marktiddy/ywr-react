(to an extent)</p>\n<p>I was also pondering on this drunk guy who evidentially new the Christian message, he sung a couple of songs during the prayer time and seemed genuinely happy to be at church and had no inhibitions&#8230;probably because he was slightly worse for wear but never-the-less I found it inspiring, I think too often we go to church out of duty, we do the things everyone else does, always too proud to do what we feel deep down we want to do to praise God, too often we make Christianity a religion rather than a relationship.</p>\n","slug":"church-went-wrongand-it-was-good"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"48c00804-3151-514a-9451-8bcb36e08254"}}}
