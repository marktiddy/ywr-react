However too often in churches this remains a rigid structure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Suddenly change a song or an order can make people uneasy, changing the order can panic people. Stopping to put in a time of prayer not scheduled in can cause mayhem because we like our little comfort zones.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">God however is a God who by very nature should make us uncomfortable. As Christians we should constantly be made to feel uneasy by God and at the same time secure in the knowledge that he is Lord of Lords and King of Kings.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fact is we have allowed church to be cosy, we have tried to please everyone, tried to put in something for all. We have tried to make it a place people are comfortable in and by doing that I believe we have put God inside a box.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We have written into our services times when God can move, for example a ‘response time’, but what if God wants a response somewhere else? Do we let him?</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It’s easy to try and prepare sermons where we beat around the bush, avoiding the tiniest chance that we might offend someone…not correct me if I’m wrong (and I’m pretty sure I’m not) but Jesus did some serious offending, in fact Jesus offended the people he was meant to be serving so much they had him crucified.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">I’m not suggesting a pastor should drive the church to that extreme but I am suggesting that in order to be more like Jesus we need to be more daring, we need to be different, we need to take<span>  </span>people out their comfort zone and let God show them the wonder that he is.</span></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8d8cbec7-5370-5f0b-a692-0a8e66de530c"}}}
