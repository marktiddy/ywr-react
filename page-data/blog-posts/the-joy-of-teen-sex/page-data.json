As a youth worker I know  that a lot of the stats they use have probably been produced by asking a  very select group of young people. To top that off if you apply the  American Pie &#8216;rule of 3&#8217; to the statistics then I suspect you&#8217;re far  closer to the facts.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach Of The Show</strong></p>\n<p>To an extent I think it&#8217;s important that we&#8217;re coming out and saying  &#8216;yes teenagers are having sex&#8217; and addressing some of the issues in the  show such as being uncomfortable with aspects of your body and  practicing safe sex&#8230;addressing the issue of drugs and alcohol in sex  are also important however I can&#8217;t help but feel the show is a little to  flippant and casual.</p>\n<p>The general feeling of the show is that young people are taking part  in sex&#8230;but not just sex but in drugs and alcohol around sex and also  having multiple partners, threesomes etc. <strong>My problem </strong>with this is  that it feels like it&#8217;s just too accepting and in particular for  ordinary teenagers watching <em><strong>I think it can create an unrealistic  expectation of sex</strong></em> and also <strong><em>encourage young people to feel  pressured into having sex earlier on and with more people</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Teen Journalist &#8216;Billie&#8217;</strong></p>\n<p>One aspect of the show which I think has been positive is features  with teen journalist Billie who whilst isn&#8217;t a gifted interviewer (or  especially engaging for that matter) is very honest and perhaps more  realistic in her approach. For example Billie has explored glamor  modeling, pole dancing and drugs, alcohol and sex. Unlike the rest of  the show the young journalist has talked to people who use them, had  some experiences (where appropriate) and made a very honest and open  opinion about them&#8230;often saying that she wouldn&#8217;t do it or just  doesn&#8217;t get it and in my opinion for young people watching the show this  is the most useful section&#8230;Billie makes it acceptable to not like  what everyone else is doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Overall I think &#8216;The Joy of Teen Sex&#8217; is a scary programme. I think  it&#8217;s a risky and potentially damaging programme for young people to  watch and probably scary for parents. As a youth worker it does make me  aware of some issues facing young people and is certainly worth watching  from an informative perspective but the attitude it promotes towards  sex is just that little bit too accepting and encouraging for my liking.</p>\n<p><em>Have you seen it?
