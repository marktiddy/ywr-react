We don’t want someone to do it all. We’re seeking the person God is calling to encourage, inspire, teach and disciple others to join in with what the Holy Spirit is doing.</p>\n<p>Could this be you? It might be if you have experienced Jesus using you in both evangelistic and discipleship settings, and are hungry for more of the same; if you’re called to Peckham in all its vibrant SE15 diversity; if you’re not just an enthusiast but also a strategic thinker.
