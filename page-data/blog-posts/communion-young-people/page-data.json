After this the minister talks about the wine and the deacons distribute small cups (like shot glasses) to the congregation who keep them until a given moment when the whole church drinks as a sign of unity.</p>\n<p>Now in theory there&#8217;s nothing wrong with this however if you don&#8217;t take communion turning down the bread/wine can seem tricky and not partaking can leave you feeling left out and so a young person taking communion for the first time may feel watched but equally by not taking it they may feel the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Over Christmas </strong>I attended midnight mass at St Andrew&#8217;s Church in Gorleston and I was reminded of the way the Anglicans do communion. In the Anglican church people go up, kneel down at the alter and the minister or a member of the lay team will serve the bread and wine, everyone drinks the wine from the same cup too!</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to take communion you don&#8217;t hold your hands open and the minister will pray for you, children are often encouraged to kneel next to the adults taking communion and be prayed for, there&#8217;s no pressure about taking communion but at the same time the concept isn&#8217;t alien to them.</p>\n<p>The way the Baptist church does communion (although some may do it very differently) risks alienating a generation of young people from communion. <strong>We risk bringing up children who don&#8217;t understand the meaning of communion and just see it as &#8216;something the adults do&#8217;</strong>, this saddens me because communion can be and should be a spiritual experience whether you take the bread and wine whether you receive a blessing.</p>\n<p>So if anyone has any suggestions for how we can make it more relevant let me know! How does your church do communion?</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0a713003-a6f6-5e8d-890f-c3160305c07c"}}}
