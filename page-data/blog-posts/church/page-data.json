I think that poses an interesting question, one of my aims when I do church is to try and do something different however I&#8217;ve been falling into the sandwich trap, whereby you end up structuring a service exactly the same as it is always done and I think too often in church we&#8217;re confided by times, and thoughts of how old Dorris will complain if we don&#8217;t have a organ hymn, or if we go on for too long, and I think more often than not if God didn&#8217;t show up we wouldn&#8217;t notice (I&#8217;m trying to be general here not specific, so Park Baptist for example I think would notice, as would Tab).</p>\n<p>The fact is this, we&#8217;ve made church into something confortable, it&#8217;s cosy, there&#8217;s no surprises, you go in, sit down, sing a couple of songs, listen to talk, have some coffee and go home, church is too confortable. One way which I look at the teachings of Jesus is that he made people unconfortable&#8230;and not just a little bit he made them very unconfortable but at the same time challenged, he gave them somewhere to go from their unconfortability. Paul does the same in his letters.</p>\n<p>However it seems that more often than not church is too confortable, I go into church knowing what to expect, preachers often think carefully about their words so they don&#8217;t offend, I think Jesus probably offended quite a few people so why are our churches today scared to offend?</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know of a solution, but I think we need to make church unconfortable, I want church to be a place where I&#8217;m challenged, where I&#8217;m inspired and I want it to be a place where the love of God is experienced, not just from the church to the outside world but within the church, when did Jesus ever care about a building? or children running inside a church? He didn&#8217;t!</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"21b0833d-e19b-5a29-bae2-f734cb8d98d2"}}}
