Kleer series is a new series of videos aimed at engaging young people with issues of faith in a culturally relevant way.</p>\n<p>The resource website states &#8216;Are you looking to help young people explore their spirituality, identity, purpose and faith?&#8217; which provides a good overview for the resource (you can also download 4 to evaluate from their website)</p>\n<p>Here at Youth Work Resource I was able to download the first season to let you know my verdict and where to pick up the series. So here are my thoughts&#8230;</p>\n<p>The concept of a youth group video series isn&#8217;t new&#8230;11 years ago Rob Bell launched his Nooma series (which I still love) and in recent years as producing good quality video has become more do-able we&#8217;ve seen the Youth Alpha Film Series, Deep and various others.</p>\n<p>Whereas many of these assume some kind of spiritual knowledge from young people the Kleer series doesn&#8217;t, making it almost a pre-alpha resource. This means that it gives you a fantastic way to begin discussing spiritual issues and the big questions of life with young people in an engaging way.</p>\n<p>The format of each video is largely similar. The 6 minute videos tend to contain an introduction, some kind of testimony or anecdote/visual, a conclusion of sorts and 3 conversation starters for you to use with your group. The videos have a variety of presenters (all-be-them mostly male) who are engaging and challenging to listen to.</p>\n<p>In series 1 we see issues such as celebrity culture, spiritual journey&#8217;s, creation and personal reflection tackled amongst other issues which will be relevant to the young people you work with.</p>\n<p>As a youth worker who has previously struggled to find ways to begin those conversations of faith with young people I think Kleer is a fantastic new resource and certainly one worth picking up. It&#8217;s well produced, just about the right length and provides questions to follow up the video with young people. It could be ideal as part of a lunchtime club, God-slot or could even work in an RS lesson.</p>\n<p>Plus at £20 for 24 videos it&#8217;s also a pretty good deal!</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>So what&#8217;s the verdict? &#8211; Kleer fills a gap that has been needed to fill when it comes to youth ministry resources, it&#8217;s put together well and has some really thought provoking questions&#8230;it would have been nice to see a more balanced ratio of male to female presenters though!</p>\n<p><strong>Where to get it &#8211; </strong>Kleer can be purchased from <a href=\"http://www.kleerseries.com/welcome\" target=\"_blank\">their website</a> and also comes as part of <a href=\"https://www.yfcresources.co.uk/programmes\" target=\"_blank\">YFC&#8217;s new &#8216;Frames&#8217; resource</a> for 11-18&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a4ca9b0b-5400-5459-85a7-f713c34d452c"}}}
