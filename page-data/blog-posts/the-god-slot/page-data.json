In his book on Detached Work Richard Passmore talks about a conversation he has with some kids in a part that moves onto Christianity, often an informal open chat is far more informative for a young person than a ten minute ramble/ God Slot.</p>\n<p>I guess this is all thoughts at the moment but comments would be apreciated, what did you think of God slots when you were younger? or perhaps you experience them now? do you think they&#8217;re needed?</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4c66d351-7672-5fe4-b00d-2b197a14a722"}}}
