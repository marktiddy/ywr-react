Fairfield is a thriving, independent, evangelical Church approx. 15 miles North West of London, made up of a diverse cross-section of around 170 adults, with a high proportion of families and young people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are looking to recruit a new youth worker. This is a role in a succession of dynamic youth leaders caring for around 70 children and young people under 21 associated with Church families (and specifically about 30 in the 11-21 age group) as well as leading outreach games evenings which attract around 40 children aged 9-12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This role provides a great opportunity for an enthusiastic, energised Christian with a desire to see young people come into a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ through discipleship, evangelism and encouragement. It is a full-time role with commitments currently defined for Thursday and Friday evenings and Sunday mornings plus a Wednesday morning staff meeting. Supported by others, this person will take a lead role in organising and leading various events for our young people both internally and with other local churches and external Christian organisations (eg camps/festivals).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This role is primarily focused on the 11 to 21 age group but depending on the candidate’s experience and ambitions could be combined with oversight of our wider Children’s work. Alternatively the role could involve responsibility for our community engagement. In essence, the shape of the role can be based upon the person, taking into account our other staffing and resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We offer an attractive remuneration package dependent on experience with opportunities for training.
