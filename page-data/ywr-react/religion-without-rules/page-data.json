Annoying Christians</p>\n<p></span>As regular readers will realise I am a Christian and secondly I get annoyed by Christians (oh the irony), and one thing which has been bugging me recently is Christians making rules up, in particular things like &#8216;a boy and a girl shouldnt be alone EVER whether they&#8217;re a couple or not&#8217;, alongside the reasons such as &#8216;people might think you&#8217;re being naughty&#8217; etc. The best activity though that a boy and a girl shouldnt do advised by a Christian was PRAY.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s wrong with a boy and a girl being alone? what&#8217;s wrong with a boy and a girl being alone and praying?</p>\n<p>So the first thing that&#8217;s been bugging me is all these random rules Christians make up</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">2. The Actions Of Jesus</p>\n<p></span>I&#8217;ve also been thinking about the way Jesus acts in particular to what he says. One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that his healing isn&#8217;t conditional on people becoming Christians and also that we&#8217;re not even told what happened to those healed after&#8230;so we don&#8217;t know if they became missionaries or if they just thought &#8216;ooh I&#8217;m healed, that&#8217;s nice, I might be able to pull now!&#8217;</p>\n<p>Secondly I guess I&#8217;ve only caught on that Jesus and the Woman at the well were alone&#8230;yes and man and a women alone&#8230;not only that, no-one else was likely to go to the well at that time and not only that, she wasn&#8217;t a nice middle-class church girl who wouldn&#8217;t say boo to a goose (why would you say boo to a goose???) but she was a women who had five husbands and was having sex with another man&#8230;perhaps she was a bit of a risky character for Jesus to be alone with.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">So My Point&#8230;</p>\n<p></span>Perhaps I&#8217;m wrong but Jesus seemed to re-vamp every rule that existed and turned the religiousness of the people into a faith, a faith based purely on loving your God and loving your neighbour&#8230;a faith based on love.</p>\n<p>Part of this is I believe down to the way which the Jewish people were at the time, they didn&#8217;t just have to stick to the laws of Leviticus but clever Rabbi&#8217;s made up more, these rules got to the extreme where they were dictating what sexual positions and husband and wife could use whilst having sex, I think Jesus came to clear the way of these ridiculous rules and make God accessible, he didn&#8217;t come so we could sin unendlessly but so that we could have a relationship with God in spite of.</p>\n<p>There seems to however have been the additions of more rules as Paul writes his letters and others write in the new testament which makes me think this&#8230;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">can you have religion without rules?</p>\n<p></span>The reason I ask this is because I wonder if behaviour comes automatically when you have a loving relationship with God.</p>\n<p>For example Joanna doesn&#8217;t have to tell me not to cheat on her, she doesn&#8217;t have to remind me I shouldn&#8217;t lie to her yet I don&#8217;t cheat on her and I never lie to her and that I believe is because we have a relationship based on love.</p>\n<p>What if Christianity was like that? What if we didn&#8217;t hammer on about how what people are doing is wrong? what if we don&#8217;t condemn from a pulpit but echo the importance of a loving relationship with God constantly? What if we help people enter into a loving relationship with the creator and let God and the love they have for him stop the &#8220;sin&#8221;.</p>\n<p>What if the church has the wrong emphasis on Christianity? What if we&#8217;ve been missing the key focus&#8230;that of love&#8230;people have a problem with Christianity because they claim it limits freedom but what if we didn&#8217;t focus on what you had to give up but if we instead focused on helping people enter into a loving relationship with God and let that love control them, let the love they have for God cause them to address their own issues?</p>\n<p>A religion without rules doesn&#8217;t mean you can do anything but means the emphasis is shifted away from do&#8217;s and don&#8217;t and onto having a loving relationship with God&#8230;perhaps we don&#8217;t always need to be reminded what&#8217;s wrong to know it is&#8230;perhaps we should let love control us.<br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"></span></p>\n","slug":"religion-without-rules"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bb052a0e-7d8f-5542-97c2-b1c6674555e4"}}}
