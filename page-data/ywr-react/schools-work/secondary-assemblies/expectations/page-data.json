I will give you hope and a good future’ (Jeremiah 29:11)</p>\n<p>For me this means that I try and see the good in things that happen and so if I’m having a really rubbish day I know that there is something good coming.</p>\n<p>And that’s what I want to leave you with this morning,</p>\n<p>If you’re having a really rough time at school at the moment then it wont last forever and I want to encourage you expect something good to happen soon.</p>\n<p>As a Christian I believe that God listens to us and we can talk to Him when we’re finding things difficult and so perhaps some of you guys will want to talk to God?</p>\n<p>For those of you don’t want to there’s plenty of people around school that you can talk to about difficult times. (Peer mentors, teachers, class mates)</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening if you want to chat about anything I’ve said then when you see me around school just catch me and I’d love to hear what you have to say.</p>\n","slug":"expectations"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"41993abb-4f40-59d5-9182-2f5884fdd159"}}}
