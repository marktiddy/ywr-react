For example if your sixth formers are in very early stages  of faith a group for all ages might not work as they&#8217;ll need feeding as  much as the younger ones.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I go about setting up a group?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have a relationship with the school already then it&#8217;s worth  approaching someone on senior leadership in the school about the  idea&#8230;if there are Christian teachers you know of in school it might be  worth talking to them about what they think a group could be like  too&#8230;they might even want to get involved!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important that you get people praying about this right from the  start!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not in the school on a regular basis it might be worth  asking a Christian teacher to take overall responsibility for the group,  this way the headteacher will know the staff member in charge already  and it may make them feel at ease.<br />\n<strong>Where should I hold it?</strong></p>\n<p>Room in school can be scarce&#8230;finding a comfortable space can be  even more difficult. Whilst a classroom may not be ideal it might be the  only option you have but if you can get a meeting room with comfy  chairs then this may effect the dynamic of your group. You could  approach a Christian teacher in school about using one of their  classrooms for it.<br />\n<em><strong>Some considorations about choosing a room&#8230;</strong></em></p>\n<p>Is it in a part of the school that everyone will feel  comfortable going to, I.e. lower years may not feel comfortable going  into the sixth form area.</p>\n<p>If you want a video projector is there easy access to one where you  are?</p>\n<p>What are the chairs like? Comfortable chairs could give a more laid  back, relaxed feeling for the group.</p>\n<p>Bibles? Not everyone may have or remember to bring their bible, many  groups like to be in R.E. rooms so that they can get bibles easily.</p>\n<p><strong>When should my CU be?</strong></p>\n<p>The majority of groups meet at lunchtime however by the time students  have got lunch from the canteen this can leave you with a very short  period of time so you may need to look at potentially running it after  school. It&#8217;s important to talk to students about what they would like  from this&#8230;there&#8217;s no point running one after school if they just want  to go home!</p>\n<p><strong>What should I call it?</strong></p>\n<p>Some CU&#8217;s simply go for Christian Union&#8230;whilst this is exactly what  it says on the tin it&#8217;s also a little stuffy sounding&#8230;here are some  name ideas;<br />\nX-Plore!<br />\nExplore<br />\nSorted<br />\nDiscovery<br />\nThe Forum<br />\nCrossroads<br />\nRocksolid</p>\n<p><strong>Launching &amp; Promoting your CU</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Assemblies &#8211; </strong>An easy way to make sure everyone knows about it  is to do an assembly&#8230;you might lead the whole assembly to introduce  the idea or just do a few minutes pop-up.</p>\n<p><strong>Posters </strong>&#8211; Try and produce some eye-catching posters that can  be put up around school.</p>\n<p><strong>Digital Media </strong>&#8211; Many schools have a visual learning  environment (VLE)&#8230;Can you get a CU page on this?</p>\n<p><strong>Churches </strong>&#8211; Many students who come will already attend local  churches and youth groups so make sure you let the church&#8217;s youth  leaders know and ask them to promote the CU around the young people in  their groups.</p>\n<p><em><strong>That&#8217;s pretty much it!</strong></em></p>\n<p>As time goes on you might need to remind people that CU exists in  assemblies&#8230;you might need to tweak the programme to work for those who  come and you may even need to change the day or time but whatever  happens a CU can be a really exciting group to be involved with in  school.</p>\n","slug":"guide-to-setting-up-a-cu"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"063014bc-6366-5d6e-9d77-fa3a364ab736"}}}
