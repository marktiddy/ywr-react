Soul Survivor is the first big Christian festival I&#8217;ve been to and I went not knowing what to expect, I guess I expected plenty of hype, I expected the Holy Spirit to be doing things and I expect loud worship.</p>\n<p>Out of my expectations listed above I got two of them, I got loud worship and got to see the Holy Spirit working, my biggest surprise was the lack of hype, I guess I&#8217;m used to any church that does Holy Spirit stuff hyping it up, whether it&#8217;s with people speaking in tongues down microphones or just really influencial music. However at Soul Survivor there was none of it, Mike Pilavachi literally said a couple of words then people came and prayed for the people who came down and all they prayed was &#8216;God do your work&#8217; or words to those effect, which was pretty cool.</p>\n<p>I got to go to a couple of seminars by the legend that is Tim Hughes, one on song writing and one on worship leading, they were both really interesting and Tim had some really good points to make.</p>\n<p>Another thing I liked about Soul Survivor was that time didn&#8217;t bother them, if a meeting over-ran because God was working and it meant the band who were playing a gig there in the evening wouldn&#8217;t be on till later it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>\n<p>My only real issue with SS was the toilets, I was happy with a week of portaloos on the whole although by the end of the week some did have some interesting smells!</p>\n<p>I think next year I&#8217;m going to volunteer for SS, that way it&#8217;s free! ðŸ™‚</p>\n","slug":"soul-survivor"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e0adce06-db0e-5c84-9b20-83fd857b588b"}}}
