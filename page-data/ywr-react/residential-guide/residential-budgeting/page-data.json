Are there people in your church willing to pay for individual places?</p>\n<p>Is the site far away? Perhaps if it&#8217;s close you can request that the young people make their own way, this way you don&#8217;t need to include fuel in the budget!</p>\n<p><strong>Food Costs</strong></p>\n<p>Typically you will find that budgeting for food is the bigger thing to do, of course this can vary on your menu but typically I work on the figure of around £3 per person per day, this may increase if there are less young people. Remember it&#8217;s cheaper to cater for more!</p>\n<p>Shopping for the right amounts can always be tricky so there are some useful figures and sample menus plus advice on catering on <a href=\"http://marktiddy.githubpages.io/ywr-react/residential-guide/managing-the-food/\" target=\"_self\">our residential catering page</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Site</strong></p>\n<p>You will need to work out how much the site cost should be in the overall price of the residential, have a careful think about how many young people you will realistically take with you on the residential. Does the site you&#8217;ve booked charge per person or just for the overall site? (Either of these options has it&#8217;s advantages)</p>\n<p><strong>Activities</strong></p>\n<p>Are you planning to do activities on your residential? (I hope so!) Some cost more than others so make sure you budget these in too. It might be £5 per person for archery or just £50 overall for craft materials.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel</strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re planning to transport the young people down there do you have the right amount of cars? or do you have a mini-bus? If you&#8217;re working fuel costs into your budget I&#8217;d advise working on 15p per mile in a car and 20p per mile in a minibus&#8230;of course in reality it may cost less than this depending on the cost of your fuel at the time.</p>\n<p><strong>To continue with our residential guide <a href=\"?page_id=773\">click here to go back to the list of topics</a></strong></p>\n","slug":"residential-budgeting"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"aea829a3-23fc-5970-9d74-87004e428731"}}}
