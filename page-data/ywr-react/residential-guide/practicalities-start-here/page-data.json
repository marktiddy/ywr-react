They will need to underwrite it and pay things like your bookings fees to start with. It&#8217;s also worth encouraging them to be prepared to pay for places for young people who can&#8217;t afford to go otherwise and leader places (if you&#8217;re going on a big residential).</p>\n<p><strong>Partnership </strong>&#8211; Is there scope to run this residential alongside other churches? This can make it easier to fill up and gives you more leaders!</p>\n<p><strong>Plan Ahead &#8211; </strong>Remember to plan ahead. Young people have lots on and so the further in advance you can get the date out the better!</p>\n<p><strong>Leaders </strong>&#8211; Make sure all your leaders have had a CRB check (or equivalent police check according to your churches child protection policy and country&#8217;s laws).</p>\n<p>Also ensure that you stick to appropriate ratios of adults to young people (see tables below) sticking to the ratios for outdoor activities for the whole event.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1561\" title=\"Indoor Ratios\" src=\"http://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-13.01.52-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-13.01.52-300x169.png 300w, https://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-13.01.52-150x84.png 150w, https://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-13.01.52.png 701w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1562\" title=\"Outdoor Ratios\" src=\"http://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-13.01.58-300x174.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" srcset=\"https://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-13.01.58-300x174.png 300w, https://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-13.01.58-150x87.png 150w, https://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-13.01.58.png 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><a title=\"Residential Guide\" href=\"http://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/residential-guide/\">Click here to go back to the residential centre guide</a></p>\n","slug":"practicalities-start-here"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0372e222-9195-563b-bd5d-26987ba3cd34"}}}
