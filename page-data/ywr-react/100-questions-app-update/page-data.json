The app cost (and still costs) 99p&#8230;which we don&#8217;t think is a lot to ask for a youth work resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week we pushed an update to the App Store with a new design and some tweaks under the hood (including making sure questions didn&#8217;t repeat any more during a session).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we have launched our &#8216;Lent and Easter Questions&#8217; pack which is an in-app purchase. For 99p you can add an extra 50 questions to your app which focus on themes found throughout Easter and Lent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Some questions include:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do you have any Easter family traditions?</li><li>What gives you hope?</li><li>What can you do to show God&#8217;s love to others?</li><li>Where in the world do you see &#8216;new life&#8217;?</li><li>How do you like your eggs? Fried? Poached? Scrambled? Some other way?!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope this new pack will continue to help you engage young people in conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-text-align-center has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/100-questions-youth/id1387964565?mt=8\">Download the 100 Questions &#8211; Youth App Today!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Pssst&#8230;we&#8217;re currently working on adding an extra free pack all about social media!</strong></em></p>\n","slug":"100-questions-app-update"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"deee17ff-79b2-5ca2-b2c1-5c4fa3517a54"}}}
