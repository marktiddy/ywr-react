But for children and teenagers, they can feel even more overwhelming and unconquerable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One in eight children live with a mental health disorder, says NHS Digital. When a child or teenager has a condition such as anxiety or depression, it can seriously affect their health and wellbeing. They aren’t pleasant illnesses and can be incredibly confusing for a child to experience, who may not understand what they are feeling or why they are feeling a certain way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a child is dealing with anxiety or depression, they may try to put on a brave face to cover up their emotions and hide how they feel from others. They may also choose to keep their thoughts and feelings to themselves, as a result of being too scared or embarrassed about what they are going through. This can stop them from reaching out for the help and support that they need to get better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is valuable for those looking after children and teenagers to be able to recognise the signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression so that they can take steps to support the child.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teenage depression and childhood anxiety guides&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priory Group has put together guides on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.priorygroup.com/young-peoples-services/how-to-explain-anxiety-to-your-child\">childhood anxiety</a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.priorygroup.com/media/594578/a-parents-guide-on-teenage-depression.pdf\">teenage depression</a>containing valuable advice and information on the mental health conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These guides are useful for parents, carers and guardians. They outline the signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression, and recommend effective support and treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guides also recommend ways to talk to a child about their thoughts and feelings. Having conversations on the topic of mental health, what it is and how it can be treated can be incredibly valuable. These discussions can remove any stigma surrounding mental health and can help children to recognise that it’s ok to open up about their thoughts and feelings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For children and teenagers who are experiencing mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, it is important that they get access to treatment as early as possible so that they can manage their condition, and recover in the long term. These guides outline the treatment and therapies that can be provided at places like the Priory, which can help a child to make positive changes and learn strategies to help them stay well in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n","slug":"supporting-children-with-anxiety-and-depression"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cef2732a-3836-590c-998c-b9dbf3777cbe"}}}
