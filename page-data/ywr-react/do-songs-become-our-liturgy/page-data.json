I felt challenged by God on this a while ago whilst driving and singing to Matt Redman, and I felt God challenging me to think if I meant what I was singing.</p>\n<p>This has become a thought in my head once again recently so this blog is just a quick couple of thoughts on if we have made songs in church the new liturgy?</p>\n<p>The reasons behind this is that often in churches we have the same songs week in, week out, perhaps a variety of songs that happen every so often but do we end up just singing without thinking? It&#8217;s easy to sing along to a song you know without thinking about the meaning of the words.</p>\n<p>So here is my challenge, think about what you&#8217;re singing in church or what you&#8217;re saying, do you mean it? do you understand it? if not don&#8217;t sing it! If you don&#8217;t understand it perhaps ask someone what it means, old hymns for example confuse me (and bore me but that&#8217;s anoter story!)</p>\n","slug":"do-songs-become-our-liturgy"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cb833432-a94e-5a25-a8eb-3e69b21a30d5"}}}
