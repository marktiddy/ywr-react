True worship isn&#8217;t dependent or a song or a state of mind but on praising God whole heartedly.</p>\n<p>The second thing is something that struck me from Rob Bell&#8217;s book Velvet Elvis which I have been reading, he talks about how if God is the creator then anything that is good can glorify God, it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s Christian or not&#8230;obviously he worded it much better than I did, I&#8217;m only 3 chapters in but I think in a couple of weeks I&#8217;ll be posting telling you all to buy velvet elvis!</p>\n","slug":"a-couple-of-christiany-things"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d2233f5d-569a-53d5-bda1-2805741bf234"}}}
