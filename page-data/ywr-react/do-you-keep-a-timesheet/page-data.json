The aim was essentially to check we were doing the required number of hours.</p>\n<p>When I started my full time youth worker job just over 3 years ago I stopped keeping a timesheet for that first year and a bit but started again about 2 years ago now and would advise every youth worker to do so&#8230;let me explain why.</p>\n<p>In the year that I didn&#8217;t keep a timesheet I spent lots of my time filling time for the sake of it. My job is partly based around schools work and so during the holidays I felt the need to almost &#8216;create&#8217; work even though during other weeks I&#8217;d done some crazy term time hours (or at least by body told me I hadn&#8217;t stopped working).</p>\n<p>Since starting a timesheet I&#8217;ve found 2 things.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Firstly I do too many hours</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Secondly I can comfortably take time off &#8211; </strong>My timesheet adds up hours I&#8217;ve over-done and carries them forward to the next week which means during school holidays or less busy weeks I work less and don&#8217;t feel guilty about it because I know that I work hard enough the rest of the time.</em></p>\n<p><strong>If you don&#8217;t keep a timesheet the new year is a good time to start&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>It doesn&#8217;t take long </strong></em><strong></strong>&#8211; I probably spend about 2 minutes a day filling mine in.</p>\n<p><strong><em>You can explain how you use your time</em> </strong>&#8211; If your line-manager, management committee or others ask what you actually do with your time you actually have a point of reference.</p>\n<p><strong><em>You can enhance the quality of your work &#8211; </em></strong>When we work too much the quality of what we do suffers. Keeping a timesheet can allow you to monitor what you do and know when it&#8217;s right to take on new projects.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Guilt-free time off! </em>&#8211; </strong>It&#8217;s important that as youth workers we take a break. Keeping a timesheet allows you to comfortably take back time. It also lets you monitor when you&#8217;ve missed days off!</p>\n<p><strong>But I don&#8217;t have set hours!</strong></p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t unusual. Sadly lots of church-based youth work positions don&#8217;t give you set hours. I&#8217;m in a position where mine does (and also specifies 2 days off a week). My advice is that you have a chat to your line manager and agree a sensible amount of hours to work towards and get it wrote into your contract. The average secular job is about 37.5 hours a week so that&#8217;s a good place to aim for.</p>\n<p><em>So what&#8217;s your new year&#8217;s resolution?</em> &#8211; I&#8217;d suggest you make it to keep a timesheet&#8230;whether it&#8217;s a fancy excel one (like the one on o<a title=\"Useful Forms &amp; Documents\" href=\"http://marktiddy.githubpages.io/ywr-react/useful-forms/\">ur useful forms page</a>) or just in your paper diary.</p>\n","slug":"do-you-keep-a-timesheet"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ff09e9f8-ed25-50bd-bc9a-281cac0466b8"}}}
