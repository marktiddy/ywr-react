The residential was a joint project with other local churches and the second time we&#8217;ve run it. Out of the 20 young people we had a real mix of young people, some I already knew and some I didn&#8217;t. Some who&#8217;d come last year and some who hadn&#8217;t but as I sit here typing this the day after I wanted to share just how important residentials are.</p>\n<p>In terms of set-up ours was simple, we hadn&#8217;t got fancy activities planned just a few seasons around the theme of &#8216;how we use technology&#8217; planned by some of us leading, a walk combined with some extreme ironing (a great sport for encouraging young people on a walk), some outside and inside games plus a talent show.</p>\n<p>Once again we booked the <a href=\"http://www.yorkshirenet.co.uk/accgde/westend/\" target=\"_blank\">West End Ourdoors Centre</a> (<a title=\"Find A Residential Centre\" href=\"http://marktiddy.githubpages.io/ywr-react/residential-guide/find-a-residential-centre/\">details for residential centres where you are can be found here</a>). The centre doesn&#8217;t cost the world to hire and has fantastic facilities so we managed to price the residential at Â£60 a hear with a break-even number of 15 young people.</p>\n<p>As the weekend progressed the relationships with the young people began to grow. They got to know each other and mixed with others who they&#8217;d never met before and as leaders we had an opportunity to spend some quality time with those that we knew already and a chance to build relationships with new young people.</p>\n<p>As a young person in youth groups residentials were hugely influential. The chance to hang out with my Christian mates for the whole weekend was something I always looked forward too, there were always laughs and more spiritual moments and I remember coming back from every residential wishing it could go on forever.</p>\n<p>Being part of a community for even a weekend is hugely important. The chance for youth workers and volunteers to develop relationships and take young people on a journey for a weekend is so important for a group to grow and develop and for young people to feel more comfortable and open with those around the. Alongside that (and most importantly) a whole weekend can give young people a real chance to experience God and grow in their faith. There&#8217;s something about escaping for a weekend that can really allow God to move amongst young people.</p>\n<p>I guess it&#8217;s biblical&#8230;whilst Jesus didn&#8217;t run residentials he hung out with his disciples. He didn&#8217;t do a series of 10 discipleship sessions and send them off but spent quality time with them, getting to know them as people and not as a project.</p>\n<p>I want to encourage readers to have a think about running a residential if you don&#8217;t already. <a title=\"Residential Guide\" href=\"http://marktiddy.githubpages.io/ywr-react/residential-guide/\">Our guide (which can be found here)</a> is a great place to start.<em> Why not comment on this post for more information and help?</em></p>\n","slug":"the-residential"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e05c2f52-b65c-5b88-a1b5-42a232f7c2c7"}}}
