How do you respond?</p>\n<p>6 &#8211; Who has made a difference in your life this past school year? Is there anything you can do to say thank you to them?</p>\n<p>7 &#8211; What would a perfect summer holiday look like?</p>\n<p>8 &#8211; If you could go anywhere in the world this summer, all expenses covered, where would you go and why?</p>\n<p>9 &#8211; Name something that you want to be different about your life by the time you come back to school in September.</p>\n<p>10 &#8211; What can you do to make a positive difference for someone else this holiday?</p>\n<p>Print the above questions and put them all facedown in the centre. Get the group to each pick one and answer one (if you have a bigger group print 2 sets).

You do 3 big acts of kindness for 3 people and they then do 3 things for 3 people and so on…spreading from 1 person helping 3 to those 3 helping 9, to those 9 helping 27 and so on.</p>\n<p>In our questions activity we thought about who has made a difference to us but also what we can do to make a difference to others.</p>\n<p><b>Bible: </b>Read James 2: 14-26</p>\n<p><b>Discussion<br />\n</b>What do you think the passage means when it says ‘if people say they have faith but do nothing, their faith is worth nothing’?</p>\n<p>What does the passage say our faith should look like?</p>\n<p>The writer uses the example of someone needing clothes and getting the response ‘God be with you, I hope you stay warm and get plenty to eat’. What’s wrong with doing this?</p>\n<p><b>Small Groups</b></p>\n<p>In smaller groups get the young people to list people who need help in: school, town, on the internet, at home. Switch these lists between groups so everyone has contributed to each one.</p>\n<p><b>Discussion: </b>Back as a big group look through the lists. Which are easy things to do? Which are difficult?</p>\n<p><b>Explain: </b>It’s not about us having a list of specific things we should tick off a list to make a difference to people’s lives but always being willing to help.</p>\n<p>Jesus was always willing to stop and help others. There’s lots of times when Jesus stopped to help others he saw as he went about his day to day life…sometimes they were ill people that wanted to be healed (the woman who touches Jesus’ cloak), sometimes they were children (let the little children come to me) and sometimes they were people who weren’t very good people (tax collectors).</p>\n<p>Each of those people Jesus stopped and helped even when the rest of the world wouldn’t go near them…he often looked after their practical needs rather than telling them He’d pray for them or telling them about God. He showed them God through his actions.</p>\n<p><b>Video Clip: </b>Evan Almighty &#8211; Play from  1 hour 22 minutes to 1 hour 25 minutes (Clip at the end ‘how do we change the world? One Act of Random Kindness at a time)</p>\n<p><b>Post-It Acts &#8211; </b>Hand out post-it notes and invite the young people to each think of and write down 1 random act of kindness they could do and get them to stick them all up. Then invite them to read each others and pick one they think they could do (not their own!)</p>\n<p><b>Prayer: </b>Finish the session by praying. Ask that God would use the post it acts to make a difference to someones life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","slug":"making-a-difference-end-of-term"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cf4bfb54-688c-5838-a1bb-6159c59f9432"}}}
