Throughout the evening we’re going to have a box where you can write questions completely anonymously and we’ll look at them at the end</i></p>\n<p><i><strong> First</strong> I’d like us to split into small groups explore this idea of questioning faith (3 groups)</i></p>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong> <i>Get the groups to feedback on their experiences and discoveries</i></p>\n<p><strong>Passage Notes:</strong></p>\n<p><i>Psalm 22 &#8211; </i>The Psalm Jesus cried out on the cross, 2/3’s of the Psalms are of lament&#8230;i.e. everything sucks&#8230;the writer is in a place of despair.</p>\n<p><i>Matthew passages </i>&#8211; Jesus tells a story and the disciples question what it means&#8230;why did Jesus tell stories rather than saying it like it is? to understand it you need to question.
