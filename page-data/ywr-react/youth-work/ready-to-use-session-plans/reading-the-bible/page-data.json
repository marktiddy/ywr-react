Ask if anyone else said something they didn&#8217;t know about?<br />\n<strong><br />\nExplain:</strong> If we had got the entire congregation here and perhaps a few theologists and a few priests chances are that we&#8217;d have still missed out a lot of the bible, there&#8217;s probably loads missing from that list! The aim of this morning is not to discover the entire bible but for us to think about what it means to read the bible, and perhaps more importantly what it means to read it daily.</p>\n<p><strong>Explain:</strong> We&#8217;re not going to check up on you of take a survey of how often you read your bible, but we&#8217;re going to look at some ways of doing it and why we should.<br />\n<strong><br />\nAsk:</strong> Ask the group to think of reasons we read the bible.<br />\n(Ideas might be getting to know God, learning more, told to)<br />\n<strong><br />\nExplain:</strong> In Jesus day by the age of 10 Jewish boys would know the first five books of the bible off by heart, that is Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.</p>\n<p>By the age of 13 the top students would have the entire Old Testament memorised.<br />\n<strong><br />\nAsk:</strong> What do you think of that? Do you think you could have managed it? Can you even name the books of the Old Testament?<br />\n<strong><br />\nActivity:</strong> Ask the group to name all 39 books of the Old Testament (or try), give them 39 Balloons and get them to write a OT book on each. (the books with 2 i.e. 1 kings, 2 kings count as 2 books)<br />\n<strong><br />\nExplain:</strong> It&#8217;s harder than it looks! The reason the people of the day learnt the entire Old Testament was because it was the rules they lived by and they didn&#8217;t own their own bibles, there was 1 per village if they were lucky!</p>\n<p>When we read the bible though we learn more about God, we can read the things he&#8217;s done, the things Jesus tells us to do, have a deeper insight of his power and get to know him more.<br />\n<strong><br />\nAsk:</strong> Who here keeps a diary?<br />\n<strong><br />\nExplain:</strong> For example if I&#8217;d never met any of you but I&#8217;d read one of your diaries when I met that person I&#8217;d know more about them than I would if I hadn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Another reason we should read the bible is that God speaks to us through it, I can think of times when I&#8217;ve flicked through the bible and read a passage randomly that relates exactly to something going on in my life, it&#8217;s like an answer to prayer!</p>\n<p>You may like to give an example story<br />\n<strong><br />\nBible:</strong> Ask the group to look at 2 Timothy 3:16-17<br />\n<strong><br />\nWays To Read The Bible<br />\n</strong><strong><br />\nExplain:</strong> Reading the bible is difficult!
