Now and forever’</em></p>\n<p><strong>Explain:</strong> The last 6 weeks we have worked through the Lord’s prayer and today \t\t\twe arrive at the final line of this prayer ‘For the Kingdom, the power &amp; \t\t\tthe glory are Yours. Now and forever’</p>\n<p><strong>Ask:</strong> Can you remember what we’ve explored in the last 6 weeks?</p>\n<p><strong>Explain:</strong> This final line of the Lord’s prayer isn’t actually found in Matthew or \t\t\tLuke and is thought to have been added by early churches as a \t\t\tending for the Lord’s prayer in congregational worship&#8230;the earliest \t\t\treferences to it with the ending line are as far back at 324 A.D. and is \t\t\tfound mentioned in an old book of ‘instructions’ for Christian \t\t\tcommunities known as the Didache. It is thought to have been based \t\t\ton 1 Chronicles 29:11<br />\n(You may wish to simplify this for younger groups!)</p>\n<p><strong>Bible:</strong> 1 Chronicles 29:11</p>\n<p><strong>Ask</strong>:\t\t\tHow does this passage relate to the rest of the Lord’s prayer?</p>\n<p><strong>Explain:</strong> This passage and the concluding line of the Lord’s prayer remind us \t\t\tthat God is all powerful and that everything belongs to him. We’ve \t\t\texplored through the Lord’s prayer that God provides for us, that we \t\t\tshould trust Him and that he forgives us and this passage reminds us that \t\t\teverything is God’s and that He should have the glory.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask:</strong> What things are you good at?</p>\n<p>Do you like it when people notice?</p>\n<p>Where do you think your gifts came from?</p>\n<p><strong>Explain:</strong> We all love being appreciated for our gifts, it’s great when people \t\t\tnotice that we’re good at playing an instrument, art or telling great \t\t\tjokes, but all our gifts have been given to us by God to be used for His \t\t\tglory, we have a choice with our gifts to use them for good or for bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Video Clip</strong>:\t\tSpiderman 1 &#8211; ‘With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility’<br />\nThe clip is from 33 mins 10 seconds up to 34 mins 23 seconds</p>\n<p><strong>Explain</strong>:\t\tWhat do we mean when we say ‘for God’s glory’?<br />\n(for God to have the credit)</p>\n<p><strong>Ask: </strong>How can you use your gifts for God’s glory?</p>\n<p>How could you use them in ways which don’t glorify God?</p>\n<p><strong>Bible:</strong> 1 Peter 4:10-11</p>\n<p><strong>Ask:</strong> The passage says ‘so that in all things God may be praised through \t\t\tJesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power forever and ever.’ \t\t\tHow does this relate to our gifts?</p>\n<p>Do all of your lives give glory to God?</p>\n<p><strong>Explain</strong>:\t\tNone of us manage to live lives that give complete glory to God, we all \t\t\tdo things that don’t quite reflect God’s glory, we all say things that \t\t\thave the same effect&#8230;even youth workers and vicars! But we are \t\t\tchallenged to work towards lives that reflect God’s glory in everything, \t\t\twe won’t reach complete perfection but we can continuously improve!</p>\n<p>The last part of the Lord’s prayer reminds us to give glory to God, we \t\t\tcan give glory to him for his creation, we can give glory to him for the \t\t\tgood things we see in our lives, we can give him glory for the food and \t\t\tdrink we are provided with, we can celebrate deciding not to do a \t\t\tparticular sin we’ve been struggling with, we can praise him for \t\t\tforgiveness and we can give him glory for the gifts we have&#8230;we can \t\t\tgive him glory in everything!</p>\n<p><strong>Closing</strong>:\t\tHave a piece of flip-chart paper and a pen, invite the group to pass the \t\t\tpen around and when an individual has the pen invite them to write \t\t\tsomething on the paper they can give glory to God for&#8230;it might be a \t\t\tgift they have, a particular person who’s really helped them or \t\t\tanything!</p>\n<p><strong>Prayer</strong>:\t\tAfter the activity pray that we would see &amp; acknowledge God’s glory in \t\t\tour everyday lives.</p>\n","slug":"lords-prayer-series-7-forever"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e14b7528-1232-5d62-b4ad-39575df2046b"}}}
