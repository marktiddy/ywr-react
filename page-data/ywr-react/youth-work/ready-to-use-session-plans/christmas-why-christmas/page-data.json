Split the group into two smaller groups and challenge them to wrap one of their team members. Score them on neatness of wrapping, body covered, amount of selotape used etc.</p>\n<p><b>Ask: </b>What is your favourite part of Christmas?</p>\n<p><strong>Christmas Timeline Activity</strong></p>\n<p>Split the group into 4 small groups and ask each group to read the bible passage and timeline the events that happen in bullet form.</p>\n<p><b>Passages</b>: Luke 1:26-38, Luke 2:1-20, Matthew 1:18-25 and Matthew 2:1-18</p>\n<p>Then bring the groups back together and using a big roll of wallpaper make a big timeline of all the things that happened around Christmas time. (You could use dates from -4BC to about 0 BC (Note: Herod died just before 0BC)</p>\n<p><b>Explain: </b>We can now see the Christmas story as a bigger picture with all the parts mentioned in the bible rolled into one.</p>\n<p><b>Ask: </b>What about the Christmas story we&#8217;ve just wrote down stands out the most? Why?</p>\n<p><b>Explain: </b>If we were to summarise the Christmas story we could use John 1: 14 which in the message says:</p>\n<p><i>The Word became flesh and blood,</i></p>\n<p><i>    and moved into the neighborhood.</i></p>\n<p><i>We saw the glory with our own eyes,</i></p>\n<p><i>    the one-of-a-kind glory,</i></p>\n<p><i>    like Father, like Son,</i></p>\n<p><i>Generous inside and out,</i></p>\n<p><i>    true from start to finish.</i></p>\n<p><b>Small Groups &#8211; </b>For this you need to split your group in two and have two areas set up for the 2 activities laid out below. After 10/5 minutes switch the groups around so both will have done both activities.</p>\n<p><b>Group 1/Activity 1 &#8211; Joseph</b></p>\n<p><b>Video: </b>Watch the Joseph video &#8211;  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0oak1MwXs\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0oak1MwXs</a></p>\n<p><b>Questions</b></p>\n<p>&#8211; What was your initial reaction to this perspective?</p>\n<p>&#8211; Did it make anything in particular stand out?</p>\n<p>&#8211; Do you think it works well as a modern perspective?</p>\n<p>&#8211; How appropriate do you think the setting of this version is?</p>\n<p>&#8211;  Are any of the thoughts in the video similar to how you think you would feel in Joseph&#8217;s position? Do any differ</p>\n<p><b>Group 2/Activity 2 &#8211; Modern Day Nativity</b></p>\n<p><b>Read </b>the modern day nativity story and questions (on the next page)</p>\n<p><b><i>After 10/15 minutes switch groups over</i></b></p>\n<p><b>As a big group&#8230;</b></p>\n<p><b>Ask: </b>What (if anything) stood out from the two perspectives? Did either of them help you understand more about why Jesus coming to earth is something we should celebrate?</p>\n<p><b>Prayer</b> &#8211; In groups, thinking about the significance of Jesus coming to earth, perhaps reflecting on the message passage:</p>\n<p><i>The Word became flesh and blood,</i></p>\n<p><i>    and moved into the neighborhood.</i></p>\n<p><i>We saw the glory with our own eyes,</i></p>\n<p><i>    the one-of-a-kind glory,</i></p>\n<p><i>    like Father, like Son,</i></p>\n<p><i>Generous inside and out,</i></p>\n<p><i>    true from start to finish.</i></p>\n","slug":"christmas-why-christmas"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8041744b-1537-59d4-b055-51966f9f45e9"}}}
