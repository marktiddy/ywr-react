It must be easy to remove (can&#8217;t be tied on) and must be visible (see image).</p>\n<p>A tag can be removed by a member of the other team. It must be dropped and the person without a tag must then go to jail. They can be freed if someone from their team tags them. They must then get a new cloth from a leader.</p>\n<p>No physical contact!</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to simply get the other team&#8217;s flag back to your base without losing your tag. The flag can be passed between team members but if a team member loses their tag the flag must return to its original base.</p>\n<p>The flag at each team&#8217;s base must be visible and have no more than 2 guards.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! Nice and simple. You can play this for a while and keep scores, switch teams etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Map of Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1545\" title=\"Gameplay\" src=\"http://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-12.34.57-300x172.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"172\" srcset=\"https://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-12.34.57-300x172.png 300w, https://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-12.34.57-150x86.png 150w, https://marktiddy.github.io/ywr-react/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-26-at-12.34.57.png 919w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n","slug":"capture-the-flag"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cd175d1e-8184-5b80-8db3-6ec42998d5b2"}}}
