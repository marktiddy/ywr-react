When the high energy music starts you pass your object. When the music stops the<br />\nperson(s) with the object(s) must take a spoon/fork full.<br />\nTry to have them do this as quickly as possible, so you donâ€™t loose the momentum of the game. Start the music back up<br />\nand go again. The amount of objects you have circulating should correspond with the amount of participants (i.e. 50 &#8211; 100<br />\nteens to 5 &#8211; 10 bottles of baby food circulating). Participants should be either sitting on the floor or in chairs in a circle.<br />\nHave paper towels on hand for messes.</p>\n","slug":"hot-potato-with-a-twist-slightly-messy"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"448ebfa3-0c81-578f-8345-286f0f58b5b0"}}}
