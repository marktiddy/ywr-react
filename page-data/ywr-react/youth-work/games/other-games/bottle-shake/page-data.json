Take the remaining empty bottle and tape the neck to the neck of the other bottle to create something resembling a sand-timer.</p>\n<p><strong>The Game: </strong>Get your young people into 2 equal teams. The aim is for each person to shake all the chocolate balls from one bottle down into the other and then pass the bottle along the line to the next person who will flip the device around and do the same. The first team to have all completed wins. &#8211; Your group can then eat the chocolate balls as your session continues.</p>\n","slug":"bottle-shake"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cf921a8f-3bbc-5b10-afd3-abc390f491ac"}}}
