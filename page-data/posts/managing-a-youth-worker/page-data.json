This is a slightly shorter blog with some suggestions on the more structured side of management. As per my last blog I&#8217;m not expert but these are things I&#8217;ve found helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>1 &#8211; Timesheets<br />\n</strong>I mentioned timesheets in my past post but you can find a fancy excel one you might like to use <a href=\"http://www.youthworkresource.com/useful-forms/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>2 &#8211; Frequency Of Meetings<br />\n</strong>Over time this will change&#8230;often with new staff a management meeting might be more frequent as they settle in but it&#8217;s worth chatting with your staff about how often to meet. I&#8217;ve found that generally fortnightly is helpful for supervision meetings although alongside that you may also have team meetings where you review and plan specific groups and projects.</p>\n<p>The structure of a supervision meeting may vary but here are some things I tend to include (some of this is borrowed from CYM)<br />\n&#8211; How are things going? <em>(Scope to talk personally and work related things)</em><br />\n&#8211; What&#8217;s happened in the last week(s)? <em>(Time to reflect)</em><br />\n&#8211; What&#8217;s coming up in the next week(s)? <em>(Thinking forward)</em><br />\n&#8211; Specific issues? <em>(Things that need addressing&#8230;could be anything from lack of volunteers to safeguarding issues)</em><br />\n&#8211; Priorities <em>(What&#8217;s the main focus for the next period of time?)</em><br />\n&#8211; Training <em>(Are there any courses/events your staff member would like to attend? As supervisor you may have suggestions too)<br />\n&#8211; </em>Spiritual Support (<em>A chance to check how your worker is supported spiritually, are they meeting a mentor, managing to attend house group, do they need anything additional?)<br />\n</em>&#8211; Anything else not covered? (<em>I use this as a chance to check our last meeting&#8217;s notes to see if there&#8217;s anything we need to come back to)<br />\n&#8211; </em>Action Points (<em>This gets added to throughout and gives a list of things that both staff member and manager need to be doing)<br />\n&#8211; </em>Next Meeting Date? (<em>When are you meeting next?)</em></p>\n<p>You could also include things like having a chapter of a youth ministry book or youth work magazine article that you discuss together.</p>\n<p>Whilst the above seems very structured in reality it flows as a conversation and often I jump around between things as the conversation goes on. It&#8217;s always worth making notes so there&#8217;s some basic record of the meeting&#8230;if nothing else so you remember what you said you should be doing between meetings.</p>\n<p><strong>3 &#8211; Appraisals<br />\n</strong>To be honest, until I started my current role I didn&#8217;t know what one of these was but it was suggested by our trustees that myself and my line manager did one on a yearly basis.</p>\n<p>An appraisal is a yearly review&#8230;there&#8217;s loads of sample forms online you can find and I&#8217;d suggest you find one that looks like it&#8217;ll work for you.</p>\n<p>Essentially an appraisal includes both you and your manager filling in things beforehand and then meeting to discuss them. This allows you to<br />\n&#8211; Identify areas of personal growth<br />\n&#8211; Reflect on the last year<br />\n&#8211; Highlight targets and aims for the next year<br />\n&#8211; Explore which areas of the work are less enjoyable or fulfilling<br />\n&#8211; Identify training needs</p>\n<p>On top of this it&#8217;s also a chance to potentially implement things like a rise in salary and affirm your worker in how well things are going (or explore how to turn things aren&#8217;t when they&#8217;re not going so well).</p>\n<p><strong>Summary<br />\n</strong>Hopefully this blog has given you some very practical tips on things like supervision meetings and appraisals.
