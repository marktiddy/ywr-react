The accessibility of porn has gone from being a &#8216;top shelf magazine&#8217; product to become available at the click of a button, in fact 26 children&#8217;s characters are linked to porn sites including pokemon and action man.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important as youth workers to encourage young people to protect themselves from these dangers (and encourage their parents to put filters on their computers too), what may start off as an accidental peak can easily become an addiction.</p>\n<p>Today we have put a brand new session online aimed at exploring the issue of pornography openly and honestly with teenage boys. We hope you find it useful in your youth group.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important that this session is done with boys (having girls around will embarrass them) and it&#8217;s also important that young people are encouraged to be confidential within the group.</p>\n<p>Anyway enough blogging from us <a href=\"http://www.youthworkresource.com/ready-to-use-session-plans/porn-session-for-boys/\" target=\"_self\">click here to check out our porn session</a></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0a7686ea-24e2-55d5-bcf7-e2939fd46546"}}}
