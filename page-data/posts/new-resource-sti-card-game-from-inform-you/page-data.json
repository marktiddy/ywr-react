The game was featured in Young People Now magazine in their &#8220;just out&#8221; section and was accepted on to the UK Health Education Authorities &#8211; Health Related Resource Database.  Initial sales went well but unfortunately not long after initial trading started, the title Sexually Transmitted Diseases was changed to Sexually Transmitted Infections by the Health Authority and I was told that they could no longer promote the game as it stood.   The STD Card game was no long fit for purpose and sales stopped.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Informyou was formed, rebranding has taken place. Now officially accredited by The Information Standards (NHS) and launched for distribution globally, the pack consists of playing cards, instructions and an information booklet.</p>\n<p>Visit the website <a href=\"http://www.informyou.co.uk/\">www.informyou.co.uk</a></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fa9c1694-798c-50ab-a896-35352f1b525e"}}}
