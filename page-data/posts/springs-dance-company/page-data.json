This show aims to encourage open-mindedness, open-heartedness and dialogue.</p>\n<p>We see performances and workshops are a great resource for a community not only to share special occasions but also offer the opportunity to create positive connections with other groups in and around your neighbourhood.  Please do get in touch for a friendly chat about how best to accommodate you and yours needs.</p>\n<p>Nicole Young<br />\nTour Booker<br />\n<a href=\"&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;t&#x6f;&#58;t&#x6f;&#117;&#x72;&#x69;n&#x67;&#64;s&#x70;&#114;&#x69;&#x6e;g&#x73;&#100;a&#x6e;&#99;e&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;&#112;a&#x6e;&#121;&#46;&#x6f;&#114;&#x67;&#x2e;u&#x6b;\" target=\"_blank\">&#116;&#x6f;u&#x72;i&#110;&#x67;&#64;&#x73;p&#114;&#x69;&#110;&#x67;s&#x64;&#x61;&#110;&#x63;e&#x63;o&#109;&#x70;&#97;&#x6e;y&#46;&#x6f;&#114;&#x67;&#46;&#117;&#x6b;<br />\n</a>Direct Tel: 00 44 (0) 7905 220645</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.springsdancecompany.org.uk/\">www.springsdancecompany.org.uk</a><br />\n00 44 (0) 1634 817 523<br />\n00 44 (0) 7775 628 442</p>\n<p>Springs Dance Company<br />\n65 John Kennedy Court<br />\nNewington Green Road<br />\nLondon<br />\nN1 4RT<br />\nUnited Kingdom</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"31b35226-9c03-5d58-8b36-0aa2f8d3bf71"}}}
