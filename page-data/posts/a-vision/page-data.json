(It&#8217;s from 24-7prayer.com)</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;color:#ffcc00;font-size:small;\">The Vision</span></h3>\n<p align=\"left\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">So this guy comes up to me and says &#8220;what&#8217;s the vision? What&#8217;s the big idea?&#8221; I open my mouth and words come out like this…<br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">The vision?</span> </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">The vision is <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">JESUS</span> – obsessively, dangerously, undeniably Jesus. </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">The vision is <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">an army</span> of young people. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">You see bones? I see an army. And they are FREE from materialism. </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">They laugh at 9-5 little prisons.<br />\nThey could eat caviar on Monday and crusts on Tuesday.<br />\nThey wouldn&#8217;t even notice.<br />\nThey know the meaning of the Matrix, the way the west was won.<br />\nThey are mobile like the wind, they belong to the nations. They need no passport.. People write their addresses in pencil and wonder at their strange existence.<br />\nThey are free yet they are slaves of the hurting and dirty and dying.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">What is the vision ?<br />\n</span>The vision is <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">holiness</span> that hurts the eyes. It makes children laugh and adults angry. It gave up the game of minimum integrity long ago to reach for the stars. It scorns the good and strains for the best. It is dangerously pure. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">Light flickers from every secret motive, every private conversation.<br />\nIt loves people away from their suicide leaps, their Satan games.<br />\nThis is an army that will lay down its life for the cause.<br />\nA million times a day its soldiers </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">choose to loose<br />\nthat they might one day win<br />\nthe great &#8216;Well done&#8217; of faithful sons and daughters. </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">Such heroes are as radical on Monday morning as Sunday night. They don&#8217;t need fame from names. Instead they grin quietly upwards and hear the crowds chanting again and again: <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">&#8220;COME ON!&#8221;</span> </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">And this is the sound of the underground</span><br />\nThe whisper of history in the making<br />\nFoundations shaking<br />\nRevolutionaries dreaming once again<br />\nMystery is scheming in whispers<br />\nConspiracy is breathing…<br />\nThis is the sound of the underground </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">And the army is <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">discipl(in)ed.</span> </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">Young people who beat their bodies into submission. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">Every soldier would take a bullet for his comrade at arms.<br />\nThe tattoo on their back boasts <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">&#8220;for me to live is Christ and to die is gain&#8221;.</span> </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">Sacrifice fuels the fire of victory in their upward eyes. Winners. Martyrs. Who can stop them ?<br />\nCan hormones hold them back?<br />\nCan failure succeed? Can fear scare them or death kill them ? </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">And the generation <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">prays</span> </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">like a dying man<br />\nwith groans beyond talking,<br />\nwith warrior cries, sulphuric tears and<br />\nwith great barrow loads of laughter!<br />\nWaiting. Watching: <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">24 – 7 – 365.</span> </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">Whatever it takes they will give: Breaking the rules. Shaking mediocrity from its cosy little hide. Laying down their rights and their precious little wrongs, laughing at labels, fasting essentials. The advertisers cannot mould them. Hollywood cannot hold them. Peer-pressure is powerless to shake their resolve at late night parties before the cockerel cries. </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">They are incredibly cool, <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">dangerously attractive</span> </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">inside. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">On the outside? They hardly care. They wear clothes like costumes to communicate and celebrate but never to hide.<br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Would they surrender their image or their popularity?</span><br />\nThey would lay down their very lives &#8211; swap seats with the man on death row &#8211; guilty as hell. A throne for an electric chair. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">With blood and sweat and many tears, with sleepless nights and fruitless days, </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">they pray as if it all depends on God and live as if it all depends on them. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">Their DNA chooses JESUS. (He breathes out, they breathe in.)<br />\nTheir subconscious sings. They had a blood transfusion with Jesus.<br />\nTheir words make demons scream in shopping centres.<br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Don&#8217;t you hear them coming?</span><br />\nHerald the weirdo&#8217;s! Summon the losers and the freaks. Here come the frightened and forgotten with fire in their eyes. They walk tall and trees applaud, skyscrapers bow, mountains are dwarfed by these children of another dimension. Their prayers summon the hounds of heaven and invoke the ancient dream of Eden. </span></em></p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\">And this vision will be. It will come to pass; it will come easily; it will come soon.<br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">How do I know?</span> Because this is the longing of creation itself, the groaning of the Spirit, the very dream of God. My tomorrow is his today. My distant hope is his 3D. And my feeble, whispered, faithless prayer invokes a thunderous, resounding, bone-shaking great &#8216;Amen!&#8217; from countless angels, from hero&#8217;s of the faith, from Christ himself. And he is the original dreamer, the ultimate winner. </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana;\"><em>Guaranteed.</em> </span></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"26cc777a-314b-559b-9493-9999288d3cc4"}}}
