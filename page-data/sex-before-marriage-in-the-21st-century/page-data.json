Firstly if (as Christians) we&#8217;re meant to respect the laws of our country then whether we think sex = marriage or not the fact is we&#8217;re not married in the eyes of our country.</p>\n<p>The second problem with that view is that actually in the bible we read &#8216;for this reason a man will leave his Father and Mother and be united as one with his wife&#8217;&#8230;in the sex = marriage situation I&#8217;m not convinced that there&#8217;s any leaving of mum&#8217;s and dad&#8217;s 9 times out of 10. The other problem is that actually this is (in my opinion) the wrong interpretation of marriage in the bible.</p>\n<p>Often in biblical times before a man could marry his fiance he would have to build an extension on his parents house for them to live in (this is similar to what Jesus talks about when he discusses there being many rooms in his Father house), in other biblical times the marriage was official after sex but there was ceremonies before that (often followed by the bridge and groom going into a tent to &#8216;do it&#8217; with their guests waiting outside).</p>\n<p>Finally I think the &#8216;sex = marriage&#8217; approach loses value of marriage, I do not believe that God intends sex to be the only significant different in marriage, I believe that God intends marriage to be 2 people giving themselves completely to each other, two people committing to love each other through the good and the bad times and the easy and the hard times.</p>\n<p>However we clearly live in a society that says sex is okay, a society that pressures us to lose virginity (perhaps the film American Pie sums this view up) <strong>so is it realistic of us to expect young people to save themselves for their future missus (or mister)?</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps there are more pressures around today to have sex than there has ever been but I think there are two things we need to make clear to young people on the matter of &#8216;sex before marriage&#8217;</p>\n<p>Firstly we need to make it clear that it is entirely possible with God&#8217;s help &#8211; We need to help young people realise that it&#8217;s not a daunting, impossible target but something you can manage with God&#8217;s help, by being mature about boundaries with boyfriends/girlfriends and also (much life with alcohol) knowing your limits&#8230;if after kissing a girl you have an undesirable urge to have sex with her (and probably will then is that a good idea? The same goes for everything up to sex from &#8216;hand sex&#8217; to &#8216;oral sex&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Secondly we need to make clear the idea of God&#8217;s forgivenesss, too often young people feel guilt when they&#8217;ve made mistakes in the sexual area, and often I think the church causes that guilt without meaning too, we need to remember (particually youth workers) that we are there to not just show young people that God can help them save themselves but at the same time help young people realise that ultimately they have a loving God who will forgive them not a God who&#8217;ll turn his back on them for a mistake.</p>\n<p>i believe that today our message of waiting for sex until marriage is no different regardless of what society says, and I believe that we need to help young people realise that, that we need to challenge societies views at the same time showing the world a loving, forgiving God.</p>\n","slug":"sex-before-marriage-in-the-21st-century"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5f88bb5f-c573-5b78-9328-be8780a010f0"}}}
