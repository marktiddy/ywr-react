If a Christian operates a business you&#8217;d expect them to treat their customers and staff in a way which would reflect the way Christ treated everyone.</p>\n<p>The same way (in my opinion) if as Christians we can make sure that we can reflect these views and morals Jesus set out within our banking and investment principals then we should. If we decide that as a Christian war is wrong then is it right to be investing in the arms trade through our banking?</p>\n<p>I know that it&#8217;s impossible to know what the big high-street banks like Lloyds, Halifax, HSBC, Barclays and Natwest do with our money but it is possible to know what certain banks such as The Co-operative bank, Smile and Triodos <strong>don&#8217;t do</strong> with our money.</p>\n<p>So I put it to you that as Christians Christ should be the centre of every aspect of our lives right from the way we treat people up to the way in which we shop and bank.</p>\n<p>Remember banking is important to Jesus&#8230;&#8217;Jesus saves!&#8217;</p>\n","slug":"faith-ethical-banking"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f226f07d-3a26-5d2f-ba98-64503411c9b5"}}}
