The letter you’re going to hear is taken from one of their albums and serves as an introduction to one of their songs but it’s actually a real letter.</p>\n<p>The letter was written by Mark Hoppus, the bassists Grandad to his Grandmother during World War 2.</p>\n<p><b>Play: </b>Prologue from ‘Stockholm Syndrome’ by Blink-182 (off their self-titled album)</p>\n<p><b>Explain</b>: When we think about remembering people who’ve gone off to war unless we have relatives and stories passed down through our families we often don’t think about the sacrifice individuals made to work towards peace by going off to war.</p>\n<p>People who left their loved ones.</p>\n<p>Left their Mums or Dads</p>\n<p>Left their Husbands or Wives</p>\n<p>Left their Brothers or Sisters</p>\n<p>To go off to the unknown, not knowing if they’d return or not but doing that so future generations like us could live in a peaceful country and that’s a huge thing for someone to do and as we remembered last week many didn’t return.</p>\n<p>And peace is really important…Jesus said “<i>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God</i>’ (Matthew 5:9)</p>\n<p>So to finish assembly I want to show you a short reading of the poem ‘For the Fallen’ which has been put together by the Church of England and we’ll just have a few moments of silence after it for you to reflect on the words,</p>\n<p>Thank you for listening to me this morning</p>\n<p><b>Video: </b>Remembering (Church of England)</p>\n","slug":"remembering-remembrance-assembly"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8b801a8c-0b90-5144-b76d-c64587101a12"}}}
