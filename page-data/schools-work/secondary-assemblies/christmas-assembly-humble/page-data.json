Let’s go back to when the very moment he was born, after all that’s what Christmas is all about…</p>\n<p>“There were sheepherders camping in the neighbourhood. They had set night watches over their sheep. Suddenly, God&#8217;s angel stood among them and God&#8217;s glory blazed around them. They were terrified. The angel said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid. I&#8217;m here to announce a great and joyful event that is meant for everybody, worldwide: A Saviour has just been born in David&#8217;s town, a Saviour who is Messiah and Master. “</p>\n<p>Wow, Jesus was super important.  A saviour, a superhero, here to rescue everyone, he was called Master and Messiah; a very important leader, the person that the Jews at that time had waiting years for!  He was one seriously important person.</p>\n<p>The angle continues…</p>\n<p><strong>“This is what you&#8217;re to look for…</strong></p>\n<p>Now, can you help me finish this verse?&#8230; Was it</p>\n<p>a) The most perfect looking baby, clothed head to toe in the latest Ted Baker range.  He’s in the super secure celebrity suite of Nazareth’s best private hospital.  You won’t get in though, now way! You need an Access all areas pass or you won’t even get a sniff!</p>\n<p>b) “A baby being rocked to sleep in his gold plated cradle.  He will have an entourage of over 10 people, 1 to change his nappy, 1 to wipe his bottom, 1 to check no-ones looking… 1 to check for belly button fluff, 1 to come his hair…” the angel continues “ there will be a cloud of white doves circling the room and everyone will get the day off so that they can come and bring him gifts!</p>\n<p>c) a small baby wrapped swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C</strong></p>\n<p>Jesus, the most important man to ever live and die, humbled himself. By this act of being born in a barn, to a normal man and wife, with animals surrounding him he made himself approachable, touchable, human, just like us.  Jesus doesn’t want us to see him a celebrity that we have to fight our way to see, one we need an access all areas pass to get just one minute with him.  Jesus is the very man who ended up washing his disciples feet! He wants us to be close to him and him to us.</p>\n<p>During this Christmas time our challenge to each of you is this.  Do you sometimes act more important than you are?  Do you think you’re more important than your friends?  Someone else in your class? Your family members?  Your teachers? If so, can you think of one time this Christmas time that you commit to trying to be more humble towards them.</p>\n<p><strong>End</strong>: If you’ve any thoughts or questions about this then at lunchtime we’ll be hanging around wearing ‘Ask me why I’m celebrating Christmas’ badges so ask us more or tell us about your Christmas! (If this isn&#8217;t an option then you can end the assembly at the end of talk 2)</p>\n","slug":"christmas-assembly-humble"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"YWR Gatsby","description":"Experimental version of YWR"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"080dccf6-b261-520d-8629-9efdb0cb6242"}}}
